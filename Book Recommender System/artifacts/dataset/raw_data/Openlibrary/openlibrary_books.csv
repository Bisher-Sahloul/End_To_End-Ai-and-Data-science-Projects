0375704140,Beloved,Toni Morrison,1998,Random House Large Print in association with Alfred A. Knopf,Historical Fiction ,"Toni Morrison--author of Song of Solomon and Tar Baby--is a writer of remarkable powers: her novels, brilliantly acclaimed for their passion, their dazzling language and their lyric and emotional force, combine the unassailable truths of experience and emotion with the vision of legend and imagination. It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of ""iron eyes and backbone to match."" Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. Sethe works at ""beating back the past,"" but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' ""desolated center where the self that was no self made its home."" And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D (""There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep""), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the ""place over there"" to claim retribution for what she lost and for what was taken from her. Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel. Toni Morrison was awarded the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in Literature for Beloved.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14818648-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14818648-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14818648-L.jpg,nan

8182528941,Dubliners,James Joyce,2014,Vivi Books,Short Stories ,"James Joyce's disillusion with the publication of Dubliners in 1914 was the result of ten years battling with publishers, resisting their demands to remove swear words, real place names and much else, including two entire stories. Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'. Joyce's aim was to tell the truth -- to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century. By rejecting euphemism, he would reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality, the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country. Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners -- a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled -- and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation. - Back cover.
Dubliners is a collection of vignettes of Dublin life at the end of the 19th Century written, by Joyce’s own admission, in a manner that captures some of the unhappiest moments of life. Some of the dominant themes include lost innocence, missed opportunities and an inability to escape one’s circumstances.
Joyce’s intention in writing Dubliners, in his own words, was to write a chapter of the moral history of his country, and he chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis. He tried to present the stories under four different aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life.
   ‘The Sisters’, ‘An Encounter’ and ‘Araby’ are stories from childhood. ‘Eveline’, ‘After the Race’, ‘Two Gallants’ and ‘The Boarding House’ are stories from adolescence. ‘A Little Cloud’, ‘Counterparts’, ‘Clay’ and ‘A Painful Case’ are all stories concerned with mature life. Stories from public life are ‘Ivy Day in the Committee Room’ and ‘A Mother and Grace’. ‘The Dead’ is the last story in the collection and probably Joyce’s greatest. It stands alone and, as the title would indicate, is concerned with death.

Filled with unforgettable characters, mind-bending speculation, and nonstop action, I, Robot is a powerful reading experience from one of the master storytellers of our time.
I, ROBOT
They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey hitman orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on perhaps its greatest adventure: the invention of the first positronic man. It was a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either.
As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Human men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians, and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world. And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity obsolete?
In l, Robot Isaac Asimov changes forever our perception of robots, and human beings and updates the timeless myth of man's dream to play god. with all its rewards—and terrors.

Now widely read and admired, The Awakening has been hailed as an early vision of woman's emancipation. This sensuous book tells of a woman's abandonment of her family, her seduction, and her awakening to desires and passions that threaten to consume her. Originally entitled ""A Solitary Soul,"" this portrait of twenty-eight-year-old Edna Pontellier is a landmark in American fiction, rooted firmly in the romantic tradition of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson. Here, a woman in search of self-discovery turns away from convention and society, and toward the primal, irresistibly attracted to nature and the senses. The Awakening, Kate Chopin's last novel. has been praised by Edmund Wilson as ""beautifully written."" And Willa Cather described its style as ""exquisite,"" ""sensitive"" and ""iridescent."" This edition of The Awakening also includes a selection of short stories by Kate Chopin.

Picasso later added sculptures, graphic works, and ceramics to this collection, forming the basis for what would be France's first museum dedicated to him, inaugurated in 1966 as Musée Picasso, Antibes.This catalog, published in conjunction with the exhibition of Palazzo Grassi, comprises a great selection of the most outstanding works from the Musée Picasso of Antibes, a large number of which have never been shown beyond the museum's walls. These include the murals La Joie de Vivre, 1946, The Sea Urchin Eater, 1946, and the impressive sculpture Head of Woman with Chignon, 1932.

All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.--From dust jacket.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15148503-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15148503-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15148503-L.jpg,nan

7540766212,Liao bu qi de gai ci bi,F. Scott Fitzgerald,2013,Li jiang chu ban she,Autobiographies ,"Here is a novel, glamorous, ironical, compassionate – a marvelous fusion into unity of the curious incongruities of the life of the period – which reveals a hero like no other – one who could live at no other time and in no other place. But he will live as a character, we surmise, as long as the memory of any reader lasts.
""There was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life.... It was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.""
It is the story of this Jay Gatsby who came so mysteriously to West Egg, of his sumptuous entertainments, and of his love for Daisy Buchanan – a story that ranges from pure lyrical beauty to sheer brutal realism, and is infused with a sense of the strangeness of human circumstance in a heedless universe.
It is a magical, living book, blended of irony, romance, and mysticism.

His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices, celibacy, and a life without violence.

As voices of protest and change rose above the din of history and false promises, one sounded more urgently, more passionately than the rest. Malcolm X - once called the most dangerous man in America - challenged the world to listen and learn the truth as he experienced it.
And his enduring message is as relevant today as when he first delivered it.""--BOOK JACKET.
""This is the first hardcover edition of this classic autobiography since it was originally published in 1964. In its searing pages, Malcolm X the Muslim leader, firebrand, and anti-integrationist, tells the extraordinary story of his life and the growth of the Black Muslim movement to veteran writer and journalist Alex Haley.
In a unique collaboration, Alex Haley worked with Malcolm X for nearly two years, interviewing, listening to, and understanding the most controversial leader of his time.""--BOOK JACKET.
""Raised in Lansing, Michigan, Malcolm Little's road to world fame was as astonishing as it was unpredictable. After drifting from childhood poverty to petty crime, Malcolm found himself in jail. It was there that he came into contact with the teachings of a little-known Black Muslim leader named Elijah Muhammed. The newly renamed Malcolm X devoted himself body and soul to the teachings of Elijah Muhammed and the world of Islam, and became the Nation's foremost spokesman.
When his own conscience forced him to break with Elijah Muhammed, Malcolm founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity, to reach African Americans across the country with an inspiring message of pride, power, and self-determination.""--BOOK JACKET.
""The Autobiography of Malcolm X defines American culture and the African-American struggle for social and economic equality that has now become a battle for survival. His fascinating perspective on the lies and limitations of the American Dream, and the inherent racism in a society that denies its non-white citizens the opportunity to dream, gives extraordinary insight into the most urgent issue of our day.""--BOOK JACKET.
""The Autobiography of Malcolm X stands as the definitive statement of a movement and a man whose work was never completed, but whose message is timeless. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand America.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7885134-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7885134-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7885134-L.jpg,nan

On April 1, 1924, because of the sentence handed down by the People's Court of Munich, I had to begin that day, serving my term in the fortress at Landsberg on the Lech. Thus, after years of uninterrupted work, I was afforded for the first time an opportunity to embark on a task insisted upon by many and felt to be serviceable to the movement by myself. Therefore, I resolved not only to set forth, in two volumes, the object of our movement, but also to draw a picture of its development. From this more can be learned than from any purely doctrinary treatise. That also gave me the opportunity to describe my own development, as far as this is necessary for the understanding of the first as well as the second volume, and which may serve to destroy the evil legends created about my person by the Jewish press. - Preface.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14844088-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14844088-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14844088-L.jpg,nan

Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations.

Der Roman lässt sich als historischer Roman, Zeitroman, Schelmenroman und Entwicklungsroman charakterisieren.
Set against the backcloth of National Socialism, [this novel] is told in the first person by the central figure, Oskar Matzerath, tracing Oskar's history, beginning with his grandparents, and finishing at his thirtieth birthday (1954). Oskar is a dwarf, whose passion is his tin drum, which exercises some of the power of the Pied Piper's pipe, and he possesses a voice which is capable of breaking glass of all kinds at considerable range. The magic of Oskar's voice is matched by his ability to arrest his growth, but here, as elsewhere, the book moves on two planes, for the adult burgher world believes that his failure to develop is due to a fall. The grotesque figure of Oskar is accompanied by a grotesque series of happenings throughout his life, especially the eccentric deaths of those around him ...

First published in 1929, Mann's novel tells the story of Hans Castorp, a modern everyman who spends seven years in an Alpine sanatorium for tuberculosis patients, finally leaving to become a soldier in World War I. Isolated from the concerns of the everyday world, he is exposed to the wide range of ideas that shaped a world on the verge of explosion. Considering what was to follow, the most poignant moment comes when Naphta, a Jewish-born Jesuit, defends the use of terror and the taking of life for the sake of an all-encompassing idea. Woods's work reads more naturally than the original translation, which, while faithful to the German, was stiff and forbidding.

How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.

0099590085,Sapiens,Yuval Noah Harari,2015-04-30,Vintage Books,Indonesia ,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.”
One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?
Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.
Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Unable to bear living with Phillotson, she returns to live with Jude and eventually bears his children out of wedlock. Their poverty and the weight of society's disapproval begin to take a toll on Sue and Jude; the climax occurs when Jude's son by Arabella hangs Sue and Jude's children and himself. In penance, Sue returns to Phillotson and the church. Jude returns to Arabella and eventually dies miserably. The novel's sexual frankness shocked the public, as did Hardy's criticisms of marriage, the university system, and the church. Hardy was so distressed by its reception that he wrote no more fiction, concentrating solely on his poetry.Please Note:  This book is easy to read in true text, not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher.

7806572619,Chun zhen nian dai,Edith Wharton,2002,Yi lin chu ban she,Italian ,"Edith Wharton's most famous novel, written immediately after the end of the First World War, is a brilliantly realized anatomy of New York society in the 1870s, the world in which she grew up, and from which she spent her life escaping. Newland Archer, Wharton's protagonist, charming, tactful, enlightened, is a thorough product of this society; he accepts its standards and abides by its rules but he also recognizes its limitations. His engagement to the impeccable May Welland assures him of a safe and conventional future, until the arrival of May's cousin Ellen Olenska puts all his plans in jeopardy. Independent, free-thinking, scandalously separated from her husband, Ellen forces Archer to question the values and assumptions of his narrow world. As their love for each other grows, Archer has to decide where his ultimate loyalty lies. - Back cover.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12029026-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12029026-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12029026-L.jpg,nan

Initiations, introductions, philosophical arguments about the benefits of sea voyages are, we note, from the first person, on behalf of Ishmael. Initially, Izmail appears before the reader is a mature, wise man. Then suddenly it turns out that Ishmael is a very young man, a romantic hero who wants to see the world. Behavior, words, deeds, thoughts vividly testify to this. His acquaintance with Quique, the entire length of time before getting on board the Pecoda, all this concerns young Ishmael. Here it becomes clear that the original ""Ismail philosopher"" is someone else, perhaps the author himself.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14853990-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14853990-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14853990-L.jpg,nan
0521402344,This Side of Paradise,F. Scott Fitzgerald,1995,Cambridge University Press,Italian ,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise was the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy postwar decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors - in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology - that peppered his text.
This new edition, prepared with the most recent techniques of modern scholarly editing, brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald's original manuscript.
The volume includes a detailed account of the novel's creative and textual history; facsimiles from the early drafts; full textual apparatus; and a chronology of composition and publication. Explanatory notes gloss Fitzgerald's topical and historical references. Freeing the novel of its history of textual error, the current edition offers the reading public a more accurate and accessible This Side of Paradise than ever before.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/336988-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/336988-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/336988-L.jpg,nan

Her comprehensive survey shows compellingly how photography has sharpened, if not altered forever, our perception of the world. The book was written to introduce students to photography. It does not require that students possess any technical know-how and can be taught without referring to techniques in photography. Incorporating the latest research and international uses of photography, the text surveys the history of photography in such a way that students can gauge the medium's long-term multifold developments and see the historical and intellectual contexts in which photographers lived and worked. It also provides a unique focus on contemporary photo-based work and electronic media."" --Publisher description.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12640553-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12640553-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12640553-L.jpg,nan

0442257368,Cultural anthropology,Serena Nanda,1980,Van Nostrand,Anthropology ,"Cultural Anthropology integrates critical thinking, explores rich ethnographies, and prompts students to skillfully explore and study today’s world. Readers will better understand social structures by examining themselves, their culture, and cultures from all over the globe. Serena Nanda and Richard L. Warms show how the analytical understandings and tools derived from over a century of systematically collecting data and thinking about culture can help students analyze, understand, and act effectively in the world. With a practical emphasis on areas such as medicine, forensics, development and advocacy, this book takes an applied approach to anthropology.
The authors cover a broad range of theories, both historical and contemporary, without any insistence on any particular approach, and balance it with applied, contemporary, real-world global issues. The new Twelfth Edition includes a wealth of new examples and over 500 references that update ethnographic examples, statistical information, and theoretical approaches.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11613350-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11613350-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11613350-L.jpg,nan

If we wear Donna Karan, Moschino, Gaultier or Westwood, what statements do we make? Are there any real differences between Punk and the New Look? In Fashion as Communication Malcolm Barnard introduces fashion and clothing as a way of communicating class, gender, sexuality and social identities.
This interdisciplinary work clearly analyses how fashion and clothing have been understood as modern and postmodern phenomena. Drawing on the theoretical approaches to culture, in particular those of Simmel, Derrida, Baudrillard and Jameson, the author assesses the consequences of postmodernism for fashion as a mode of communication. Concepts such as class, gender, reproduction and resistance are explored in a clear and concise manner and further reading on each subject is detailed.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3815923-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3815923-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3815923-L.jpg,nan

Far away through the forest might be heard its musical clangor and swell. Peat-cutters on Blackdown and fishers upon the Exe heard the distant throbbing rising and falling upon the sultry summer air. It was a common sound in those parts - as common as the chatter of the jays and the booming of the bittern. Yet the fishers and the peasants raised their heads and looked questions at each other, for the angelus had already gone and vespers was still far off. Why should the great bell of Beaulieu toll when the shadows were neither short nor long?   All round the Abbey the monks were trooping in. Under the long green-paved avenues of gnarled oaks and of lichened beeches the white-robed brothers gathered to the sound. From the vine-yard and the vine-press, from the bouvary or ox-farm, from the marl-pits and salterns, even from the distant iron-works of Sowley and the outlying grange of St.Leonard's, they had all turned their steps home-wards",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9910197-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9910197-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9910197-L.jpg,nan

3791313711,Alberto Giacometti,Alberto Giacometti,1994,Prestel, Painting ,"One of the great masters of 20th-century art, the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti captured the existential loneliness of modern humanity with his spindly, attenuated figures whose life-like gazes pierce the vastness of space. Uniting more than 250 sculptures, paintings, drawings and graphic works, this extensive monograph is an exemplary overview of his oeuvre.
The book underscores the continuity between the two remarkable bodies of work that characterize his career: the pre-1935 works, which included the finest of all Surrealist sculptures, and the post-war masterpieces. As a result of a profound artistic crisis that began in 1934, when Giacometti returned to working from the model and thus broke with the Surrealists, the artist began tackling the problem of situating figures in space in an entirely new way.
Painting played a key role in the solutions that Giacometti found to this problem, and the discussion here of the relationship between his two- and three-dimensional works reveals him to have been as great a painter as he was a sculptor.
Contributions by several notable art historians address contemporary research issues and offer a comprehensive record of Giacometti's life and work. Among the many photographs of the artist and his circle are images by such notable photographers as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ugo Mulas and Man Ray.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1026822-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1026822-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1026822-L.jpg,nan

Norton,Psychology ,"""Because the role of woman as a contributing member of society comes increasingly under scrutiny, Karen Horney's thoughts and theories about feminine psychology are particularly relevant to our day. In this new collection of papers, many previously unavailable in English, Karen Horney brings to the subject of femininity both profound knowledge of women and dedicated skill as a therapist. As a psychoanalytic pioneer who trained at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute in the 1920's, Dr. Horney began to question certain of Freud's theories, especially his libido theory, which her own careful clinical observations seems to contradict. At the same time her reading in anthropology strengthened her feeling that an organism's behavior is determined culturally as well as biologically. A male-oriented, materialistic society, such as the one into which Freud was born, would evolve theories of separate male and female psychologies. In such a society a woman's outlook on life would appear to be determined by her envy of the male sex organ. According to Dr. Horney, what woman really envies are masculine attributes and the opportunities society offers more readily to men. In this book her discussion of such subjects as frigidity, the problem of monogamy, maternal conflicts, feminine masochism, and the neurotic need for love offers valuable insights into the problems confronting women today - the problesm taht they bring to psychiatrists, marriage counselors, and clergymen.""--Publisher's description.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6601059-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6601059-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6601059-L.jpg,nan

Publicado en junio de 1924, el poemario lanzó a su autor a la fama con apenas 19 años de edad, y es una de las obras literarias de mayor renombre del siglo XX en el idioma español. Audazmente metafórica y sensual, esta colección yuxtapone la pasión juvenil con la desolación del dolor. Extraídos de las conexiones más íntimas y personales del poeta, los poemas combinan el erotismo y el mundo natural con la influencia del expresionismo y el genio del poeta. El propio Neruda señaló que Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada es el resultado consciente de sustituir la ambición poética y la gran elocuencia que trataba de abarcar los misterios del hombre y el universo por un nuevo modo. El vocabulario es en general sencillo, aunque pertenece al dominio de la lengua literaria convencional desde el romanticismo y el modernismo.

Boldly metaphorical and sensual, this collection juxtaposes youthful passion with the desolation of grief. Drawn from the poet's most intimate and personal connections, the poems combine eroticism and the natural world with the influence of Expressionism and the poet's genius. Neruda himself noted that Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair is the conscious result of replacing poetic ambition and grand eloquence that sought to encompass the mysteries of man and the universe with a new mode.

Fighting against the Fascists, he described in painfully vivid and occasionally comic detail life in the trenches —with a ""democracy army"" composed of men with no ranks, no titles, and often no weapons— and his near-fatal wounding. As the politics became tangled, Orwell was pulled into a heartbreaking conflict between his own personal ideals and the complicated realities of political power struggles.
Considered one of the finest works by a man V. S. Pritchett called ""the wintry conscience of a generation,"" Homage to Catalonia is both Orwell's memoir of his experiences at the front and his tribute to those who died in what he described as a fight for common decency.

2724231740,Les Aventures d'Olivier Twist,Charles Dickens,1986-10-06,France loisirs, Design ,"Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress, is the second novel by English author Charles Dickens. It was originally published as a serial from 1837 to 1839, and as a three-volume book in 1838. The story follows the titular orphan, who, after being raised in a workhouse, escapes to London, where he meets a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin, discovers the secrets of his parentage, and reconnects with his remaining family.
Oliver Twist unromantically portrays the sordid lives of criminals, and exposes the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century.[2] The alternative title, The Parish Boy's Progress, alludes to Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, as well as the 18th-century caricature series by painter William Hogarth, A Rake's Progress and A Harlot's Progress.
In an early example of the social novel, Dickens satirises child labour, domestic violence, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens's own experiences as a youth contributed as well, considering he spent two years of his life in the workhouse at the age of 12 and subsequently, missed out on some of his education.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10444587-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10444587-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10444587-L.jpg,nan

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.
Lawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch's children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

An immensely popular tale ever since its original publication, “Gulliver’s Travels” is the story of its titular character, Lemuel Gulliver, a man who loves to travel. A series of four journeys are detailed in which Gulliver finds himself in a number of amusing and precarious situations. In the first voyage, Gulliver is imprisoned by a race of tiny people, the Lilliputians, when following a shipwreck he is washed upon the shores of their island country. In his second voyage Gulliver finds himself abandoned in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, where he is exhibited for their amusement. In his third voyage, Gulliver once again finds himself marooned; fortunately he is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom devoted to the arts of music and mathematics. He subsequently travels to the surrounding lands of Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan. Finally in his last voyage, when he is set adrift by a mutinous crew, he finds himself in the curious Country of the Houyhnhnms. Through the various experiences of Gulliver, Swift brilliantly satirizes the political and cultural environment of his time in addition to creating a lasting and enchanting tale of fantasy.

9780470727249,Achieving business success with GIS,Bruce Douglas,2008,Wiley,Business Success ,"Written at a practical level, suited to the business audience, this exceptional book explores the business environment of making GIS successful. It applies academic rigor to practical and commercial implementation issues and offers viewpoints from all parties involved in GIS implementation. Achieving Business Success with GIS provides tangible advice ranging from technical and financial to organizational and commercial. It is unique in that it does not stop short of providing, without hype or embellishment, practical advice and real examples regarding the total cost of ownership of a project or finance and return investment of GIS products. Achieving Business Success with GIS highlights that the use of GIS technology needs to be focused on the business issues, not the technology.    The book begins by describing the use of GIS in a global context within a business environment as the background to outlining the need for organizations to have a strategy for their GIS.  The book then goes on to explore the elements of a GIS strategy and explains issues which are relevant for such approaches and how to go about developing it.    In the closing chapters of this book, the process of specifying and tendering for a GIS are discussed to ensure that the focus of the reader remains on the business issues of the organization. This is followed by examples of the best and worst Geographic Information Systems including a discussion on Google Earth and Web 2.0.   The combination of the statistics from the GIS / Spatial surveys and the author's consulting experiences make this book an invaluable resource for GIS managers in government (federal, state and local) and utilities, organisations using GIS, and students and lecturers in this field.",https:/images/icons/avatar_booS.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booM.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booL.png,nan

1501135910,Shoe dog,Phil Knight,2016,"Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, Inc.",Dogs ,"""In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company's early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world's most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands. In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business--a business that would be dynamic, different. Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream--along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything""--",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14809846-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14809846-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14809846-L.jpg,nan

   A fabulous introduction from Ruth Ainsworth herself expresses her feelings about the book and also her reasons for all the content. I do love her last paragraph as being a mother of five, grandmother of 19 and great grandmother of 8, I have much experience with bedtime stories. I quote :
   ""A child being read to is a happy child, but the blessing is on the reader, too. Such shared joys are unforgettable. Such hours come back again and again in memory, when the little listener has become the parent and reader in their turn. To be able to look back with delight on the lovely story times of their youth, and take care that their own children have the same delight.""",https:/images/icons/avatar_booS.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booM.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booL.png,nan

Artists considering how they work--in letters, diaries, interviews, beguilingly compiled and edited by Mason Currey. Portraits that inspire, amuse, and delight and that reveal the profound fusion of discipline and dissipation through which the artistic temperament is allowed to evolve, recharge, emerge. From Beethoven and Kafka to George Sand, Picasso, Woody Allen and Agatha Christie; from Leo Tolstoy and Henry James to Charles Dickens and John Updike, here are writers, composers, painters, choreographers, playwrights, philosophers, caricaturists, comedians, poets, sculptors, and scientists on how they create (and avoid creating) their creations. A Sampling of Daily Rituals Charles Dickens Dickens's eldest son recalled that, ""no city clerk was ever more methodical or orderly than he; no humdrum, monotonous, conventional task could ever have been discharged with more punctuality or with more business-like regularity than he gave to the work of his imagination and fancy."" Dickens rose at 7:00, had breakfast at 8:00, and was in his study by 9:00. He stayed there until 2:00, taking a brief break for lunch with his family, during which he often seemed to be in a trance, eating mechanically and barely speaking a word before hurrying back to his desk. On an ordinary day he could complete about two thousand words, but during a flight of imagination he sometimes managed twice that amount. Maya Angelou I keep a hotel room in which I do my work--a tiny, mean room with just a bed and, sometimes, if I can find it, a face basin. I keep a dictionary, a Bible, a deck of cards, and a bottle of sherry in the room ...""--

When within this striving “Brotherhood of the Arts,” two freshmen, David and Sarah, fall headlong into love, their passion does not go unnoticed—or untoyed with—by anyone, especially not by their charismatic acting teacher, Mr. Kingsley.
The outside world of family life and economic status, of academic pressure and of their future adult lives, fails to penetrate this school’s walls—until it does, in a shocking spiral of events that catapults the action forward in time and flips the premise upside-down. What the reader believes to have happened to David and Sarah and their friends is not entirely true—though it’s not false, either. It takes until the book’s stunning coda for the final piece of the puzzle to fall into place—revealing truths that will resonate long after the final sentence.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10144556-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10144556-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10144556-L.jpg,nan

After taking those four rhyming items through several permutations, more items are added (chicks, bricks, blocks, clocks), and so on. As the book progresses the Fox describes each situation with rhymes that progress in complexity, with Knox periodically complaining of the difficulty of the tongue-twisters. Finally, after the Fox gives an extended dissertation on Tweetle Beetles who fight (battle) with paddles while standing in a puddle inside a bottle (a Tweetle Beetle Bottle Puddle Paddle Battle Muddle), Knox acts on his frustration by stuffing Fox into the bottle, reciting a tongue-twister of his own: When a fox is in the bottle where the tweetle beetles battle with their paddles in a puddle on a noodle-eating poodle, THIS is what they call... a tweetle beetle noodle poodle bottled paddled muddled duddled fuddled wuddled fox in socks, sir! Knox then declares that the game is finished, thanking the Fox for the fun, and walks away while the beetles, a poodle, and the stunned Fox watch. - Wikipedia.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/254554-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/254554-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/254554-L.jpg,nan

3941579274,The economic consequences of the peace,John Maynard Keynes,2009,Management Laboratory Press,Management ,"Before becoming one of the twentieth century’s most celebrated economists, John Maynard Keynes served as a financial representative for the British Treasury at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference to negotiate the Versailles treaty which would officially end World War I. Keynes resigned from the treasury in protest about a month before the final treaty was signed, and The Economic Consequences of the Peace describes his reasons for doing so.Keynes contends that domestic political considerations and a desire for revenge led to an unreasonably high burden being placed on the defeated Germany. In making the argument he paints unflattering portraits of the then French President Georges Clemenceau, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and the American President Woodrow Wilson.According to Keynes, the effect of a negotiated treaty on the population of an already impoverished enemy was considered a far lower priority than disputes involving borders. Meanwhile, the exceptionally high cost of reparations placed on an economically-spent Germany could never be repaid, and was mainly an act of political grandstanding. Keynes predicted widespread suffering in the defeated powers, resulting in a turn towards political extremism. Unfortunately, subsequent events would prove his predictions right.The Economic Consequences of the Peace was an immediate bestseller in both the U.S. and the U.K. and has never been out of print. Though today some economists contend that Keynes may have been overly pessimistic about Germany’s ability to pay and the leniency of the Allies, many of the recommendations presented in the book were adopted as part of the Marshall Plan after the conclusion of World War II.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12744247-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12744247-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12744247-L.jpg,nan

Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers."" January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb....As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends--and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society--born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island--boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.

It introduces issues of urbanism, feminism and ethnicity, concerns which are at the forefront of current debates on architecture.
Its aim is to help people make sense of the experience of architecture and the built environment by understanding more about the form, construction, meaning and history of the subject. Lavishly illustrated, it will be of interest to students of architecture, architectural history, interior design, planning, leisure, and heritage and design.

Set on Chicago's South Side, the plot revolves around the divergent dreams and conflicts within three generations of the Younger family: son Walter Lee, his wife Ruth, his sister Beneatha, his son Travis and matriarch Lena, called Mama. When her deceased husband's insurance money comes through, Mama dreams of moving to a new home and a better neighborhood in Chicago. Walter Lee, a chauffeur, has other plans, however: buying a liquor store and being his own man. Beneatha dreams of medical school.
The tensions and prejudice they face form this seminal American drama. Sacrifice, trust and love among the Younger family and their heroic struggle to retain dignity in a harsh and changing world is a searing and timeless document of hope and inspiration.

In the person of Willy Loman, the aging, failing salesman who makes his living riding on a smile and a shoeshine, Arthur Miller redefined the tragic hero as a man whose dreams are at once insupportably vast and dangerously insubstantial. he has given us a figure whose name has become a symbol for a kind of majestic grandiosity--and a play that compresses epic extremes of humor and anguish, promise and loss, between the four walls of an American living room.

    9176370712",Frankenstein,Mary Shelley,2015,Wisehouse Classics,Plays ,"This is the Revised 1831 Edition of FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS, a novel written by the English author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley about the young science student Victor Frankenstein, who creates a grotesque but sentient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was eighteen, and the novel was published when she was twenty. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823. Shelley had travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river Rhine in Germany with a stop in Gernsheim which is just 17 km away from Frankenstein Castle, where, two centuries before, an alchemist was engaged in experiments. Later, she travelled in the region of Geneva (Switzerland)-where much of the story takes place-and the topic of galvanism and other similar occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, Percy Shelley. Mary, Percy, Lord Byron, and John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story. Shelley completed her writing in May 1817, and Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was first published on 11 March 1818 by the small London publishing house of Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones. The second edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1822 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake; this edition credited Mary Shelley as the author. On 31 October 1831, the first ""popular"" edition in one volume appeared, published by Henry Colburn & Richard Bentley. This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially because of pressure to make the story more conservative, and included a new, longer preface by her, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition tends to be the one most widely read now, although editions containing the original 1818 text are still published. Many scholars prefer the 1818 text, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Shelley's original publication.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12679895-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12679895-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12679895-L.jpg,nan

Crime and Punishment (Russian: Преступлéние и наказáние, tr. Prestupleniye i nakazaniye; IPA: [prʲɪstʊˈplʲenʲə ɪ nəkɐˈzanʲə]) is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866.[1] It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoyevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his ""mature"" period of writing.[2]
Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by comparing himself with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.

Wells,2012,Ediciones MAAN S.A. de C.V.,Literature ,"La guerra de los mundos, publicada por primera vez en 1898, narra por primera vez en la historia de la literatura un tema que será recurrente desde entonces y originará todo un subgénero dentro de la ciencia ficción: la invasión hostil de la Tierra por extraterrestres procedentes de Marte, recibidos por una humanidad ingenua que tendrá que organizarse para impedir una destrucción masiva del planeta. A través de esta fábula en la que las descripciones científicas, las premoniciones sobre el futuro de la tecnología y los entresijos de la política ocupan un lugar central, H.G. Wells nos habla sobre la vanidad y la seguridad ficticia de una humanidad autosatifecha, y los peligros que acechan su supervivencia.
When a Martian spacecraft lands on Woking Common, mankind is terrorized by aliens in tall, armored capsules which stalk the countryside on three legs.

But most of all, it is the story of the initiation into life of its naïve but sweetly appealing heroine, Catherine Morland, a willing victim of the contemporary craze for Gothic literature who is determined to see herself as the heroine of a dark and thrilling romance.
When Catherine is invited to Northanger Abbey, the grand though forbidding ancestral seat of her suitor, Henry Tilney, she finds herself embroiled in a real drama of misapprehension, mistreatment, and mortification, until common sense and humor—and a crucial clarification of Catherine’s financial status—puts all to right. Written in 1798 but not published until after Austen’s death in 1817, Northanger Abbey is characteristically clearheaded and strong, and infinitely subtle in its comedy.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14552703-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14552703-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14552703-L.jpg,nan

Newly arrived from her tour of the Continent, Sophy invites herself into the circle of her relatives. When Lady Ombersley agrees to take in her young niece, no one expects Sophy, who sweeps in and immediately takes the ton by storm. Beautiful, gay, impulsive, shockingly direct, Sophy swept into elegant London society and scattered conventions and traditions before her like wisps in a windstorm. Resourceful, adventurous and utterly indefatigable, Sophy is hardly the mild-mannered girl that the Rivenhalls expect when they agree to take her in. Kind-hearted Aunt Lizzy is shocked, and her arrogant stern cousin Charles Rivenhall, the Ombersley heir, vows to rid his family of her meddlesome ways by marrying her off.
But vibrant and irrepressible Sophy was no stranger to managing delicate situations. After all, she'd been keeping opportunistic females away from her widowed father for years. But staying with her relatives could be her biggest challenge yet. But Sophy discovers that her aunt's family is in desperate need of her talent for setting everything right: her aunt's husband is of no use at all, her ruthlessly handsome cousin Charles has tyrannical tendencies that are being aggravated by his pedantic bluestocking fiancee Eugenia Wraxton; her lovely cousin Cecelia was smitten with an utterly unsuitable suitor, a beautiful but feather-brained poet; her cousin Herbert was in dire financial straits and has fallen foul of a money-lender; and the younger children are in desperate need of some fun and freedom, and Sophy's arrived just in time to save them all.
With her inimitable mixture of exuberance and grace Sophy became the mainstay of her hilariously bedeviled family, as a horsewoman, social leader and above all, as an ingenious match-maker. Using her signature unorthodox methods, Sophy set out to solve all of their problems. By the time she's done, Sophy has commandeered household and Charles's horses, but she finds herself increasingly drawn to her eldest cousin. Could it be that the Grand Sophy had finally met her match? Can she really be falling in love with him, and he with her?

0691044562,The romance of the Rose,Guillaume de Lorris,1995,Princeton University Press,Romance ,"Many English-speaking readers of the Roman de la rose, the famous dream allegory of the thirteenth century, have come to rely on Charles Dahlberg's elegant and precise translation of the Old French text. His line-by-line rendering in contemporary English is available again, this time in a third edition with an updated critical apparatus.
Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest - against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance - to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden.
The original introduction by Dahlberg remains an excellent overview of the work, covering such topics as the iconographic significance of the imagery and the use of irony in developing the central theme of love. His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990 and beyond, which examines, for example, the sources and influences, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem's early reception.
The new bibliographic material incorporates that of the earlier editions.

In recognition of the level at which much heterocyclic chemistry is now normally taught, the authors have included more advanced material, making the book appropriate both for postgraduate taught courses and to postgraduate students.

2035834260,Cyrano de Bergerac,Edmond Rostand,2007,Larousse,Spanish ,"Cyrano de Bergerac, verse drama in five acts by Edmond Rostand, performed in 1897 and published the following year. It was based only nominally on the 17th-century nobleman of the same name, known for his bold adventures and large nose.
Set in 17th-century Paris, the action revolves around the emotional problems of the noble, swashbuckling Cyrano, who, despite his many gifts, feels that no woman can ever love him because he has an enormous nose. Secretly in love with the lovely Roxane, Cyrano agrees to help his inarticulate rival, Christian, win her heart by allowing him to present Cyrano’s love poems, speeches, and letters as his own work. Eventually Christian recognizes that Roxane loves him for Cyrano’s qualities, not his own, and he asks Cyrano to confess his identity to Roxane; Christian then goes off to a battle that proves fatal. Cyrano remains silent about his own part in Roxane’s courtship. As he is dying years later, he visits Roxane and recites one of the love letters. Roxane realizes that it is Cyrano she loves, and he dies content.

Full of mysteries and miracles, grief and dark humour, this strange play has fascinated critics and theatregoers for centuries. Theatrical and cinematic productions have tried to capture the range of interpretations and staging possibilities presented by The Winter's Tale, and the introduction to this edition explores the play's long history in performance and in criticism.

In the process he created a new literary genre known as the “Lost World” genre, which would later influence other writers like Arthur Conan Doyle and H. P.

“A unique, wholly realized other world, evoked from deep in the well of Time, massively detailed, absorbingly entertaining, profound in meaning.”—The New York Times
In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12607063-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12607063-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12607063-L.jpg,nan

0226002403,The architecture of Michelangelo,James S. Ackerman,1986,University of Chicago Press, Architecture,"In this widely acclaimed work, James Ackerman considers in detail the buildings designed by Michelangelo in Florence and Rome—including the Medici Chapel, the Farnese Palace, the Basilica of St. Peter, and the Capitoline Hill. He then turns to an examination of the artist's architectural drawings, theory, and practice. As Ackerman points out, Michelangelo worked on many projects started or completed by other architects. Consequently this study provides insights into the achievements of the whole profession during the sixteenth century. The text is supplemented with 140 black-and-white illustrations and is followed by a scholarly catalog of Michelangelo's buildings that discusses chronology, authorship, and condition. For this second edition, Ackerman has made extensive revisions in the catalog to encompass new material that has been published on the subject since 1970.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/139448-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/139448-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/139448-L.jpg,nan

0701185848,My policeman,Bethan Roberts,2012,Chatto & Windus, Film ,"Now a motion picture starring Harry Styles, Emma Corrin, and David Dawson, an exquisitely told, tragic tale of thwarted love.
“Stunning…fraught and honest.” —New York Times Book Review
It is in 1950's Brighton that Marion first catches sight of Tom. He teaches her to swim, gently guiding her through the water in the shadow of the city's famous pier and Marion is smitten—determined her love alone will be enough for them both. A few years later near the Brighton Museum, Patrick meets Tom. Patrick is besotted, and opens Tom's eyes to a glamorous, sophisticated new world of art, travel, and beauty. Tom is their policeman, and in this age it is safer for him to marry Marion and meet Patrick in secret. The two lovers must share him, until one of them breaks and three lives are destroyed.
In this evocative portrait of midcentury England, Bethan Roberts reimagines the real life relationship the novelist E. M. Forster had with a policeman, Bob Buckingham, and his wife. My Policeman is a deeply heartfelt story of love's passionate endurance, and the devastation wrought by a repressive society.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12888148-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12888148-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12888148-L.jpg,nan

The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory.

In this autobiography he holds the mirror up to his own age, telling the story of a generation that 'was loaded down with a burden of fate as was hardly any other in the course of history.' Zweig attracted to himself the best minds and loftiest souls of his era: Freud, Yeats, Borgese, Pirandello, Gorky, Ravel, Joyce, Toscanini, Jane Addams, Anatole France, and Romain Rolland are but a few of the friends he writes about.""--Publisher's description.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6634325-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6634325-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6634325-L.jpg,nan

But the growing paranoia of absolute power and the infidelity of his promiscuous young wife Messalina mean that his good fortune will not last forever.

0030596831,Daughters and rebels,Jessica Mitford,1981,"Holt, Rinehart, and Winston",Autobiographies ,"Jessica Mitford has written a gay and touching account of her growing up from childhood through early marriage. She was the sixth child of a pair of splendid English eccentrics, Lord and Lady Redesdale, and sister to Nancy, now famous for her novels, Unity, who became notorious through her attachment to Hitler, Diana, who married Sir Oswald Mosley and joined him in that strange anachronism, British fascism, and Deborah, the present Duchess of Devonshire. From the first, her definitely ""U"" background was a source of infinite boredom to Jessica and her lively account of it explains not only her own rebellion, but much about her sisters'. It seemed quite natural to little Jessica, for example, that she should learn how to shoplift. Later it was just as natural for her to fall in love with a young man she had never met. His name was Esmond Romilly, he was a nephew of Winston Churchill, and he was fighting for the Loyalists in Spain. Jessica pulled strings and things happened. She met him when he came home on leave. When he went back he was not alone. Not even the threat of the English version of the Mann Act or the arrival of her sister on a warship could tear Jessica away, and finally she and Esmond were married.
After Spain they returned to London where they had an odd assortment of friends, a great deal of fun, and almost no money - a fairly permanent condition. The last third of the book is devoted to their adventures in America and it is a rollicking account of two ""blueblooded babes in Hobohemia,"" a designation which infuriated the ""babes"" in question. We meet Esmond as a door-to-door stockting salesman (he took lessons), and as a bartender in Miami, as a guest badly in need of a shave and a dinner jacket but very well known to the butler.
Finally the long shadow of the war clouded the Florida sunshine and the Romillys started north, Esmond headed for Canada to enlist in His Majesty's forces. He left Jessica in Washington to have her baby and it is there that the book ends. It was there too that World War II put an end to her childhood, for Esmond was killed in action fighting for a world he had so thoroughly enjoyed.
Jessica Mitford's autobiography is warm, funny, and real. It proves that Nancy is not the only Mitford with the gift of wit and words.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8365542-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8365542-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8365542-L.jpg,nan

0691120544,The Muqaddimah,Ibn Khaldūn,2005,Princeton University Press,Science ,"""The Muqaddimah, often translated as ""Introduction"" or ""Prolegomenon,"" is the most important Islamic history of the premodern world. Written by the great fourteenth-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406), this monumental work laid down the foundations of several fields of knowledge, including philosophy of history, sociology, ethnography, and economics. The first complete English translation, by the eminent Islamicist and interpreter of Arabic literature Franz Rosenthal, was published in three volumes in 1958 as part of the Bollingen Series and received immediate acclaim in America and abroad. A one-volume abridged version of Rosenthal's masterful translation was first published by Princeton University Press in 1969."" ""This new edition of the abridged version, with the addition of a key section of Rosenthal's own introduction to the three-volume edition, and with a new introduction by Bruce B. Lawrence, will reintroduce this seminal work to twenty-first-century students and scholars of Islam and of medieval and ancient history.""--Jacket.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/443783-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/443783-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/443783-L.jpg,nan

The Secret Doctrine, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's masterwork on the origin and evolution of the universe and humanity itself, is arguably the most famous, and perhaps the most influential, occult book ever written. Published since 1888 only in expensive, two-volume editions of some 1,400 pages, it has long eluded the grasp of modern readers— until now.This single-volume edition, abridged and annotated by historian and Theosophical scholar Michael Gomes, places the ideas of The Secret Doctrine within reach of all who are curious. In particular, Gomes provides a critical sounding of the book's famous stanzas on the genesis of life and the cosmos...",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12991156-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12991156-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12991156-L.jpg,nan

Oliver Sacks’s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents.
If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks’s splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicine’s ultimate responsibility: “the suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject.”",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10104560-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10104560-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10104560-L.jpg,nan

He never wanted to go to war, but the leaders on Earth have drawn a line in the interstellar sand -- despite the fact that their fierce alien enemy is unknowable, unconquerable, and very far away. So Mandella will perform his duties without rancor and even rise up through the military's ranks ... if he survives. But the true test of his mettle will come when he returns to Earth. Because of the time dilation caused by space travel the loyal soldier is aging months, while his home planet is aging centuries -- and the difference will prove the saying: you never can go home.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/26336-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/26336-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/26336-L.jpg,nan

At the theater, Toby finds something on his seat -- a baby rabbit, which he takes home and names Bunnicula. It proves to be an apt name, at least as far as Chester the cat is concerned. Well-read and observant, Chester soon decides that there is something odd about the newcomer. For one thing, he seems to have fangs. And the odd markings on his back took a bit like a cape. Furthermore, Bunnicula sleeps from sunup to sundown and is awake only at night.

One boy got into the car, two did not, and something terrible happened -- something that ended their friendship and changed all three boys forever. Twenty-five years later, Sean is a homicide detective. Jimmy is an ex-con who owns a corner store. And Dave is trying to hold his marriage together and keep his demons at bay -- demons that urge him to do terrible things. When Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, Sean is assigned to the case. His investigation brings him into conflict with Jimmy, who finds his old criminal impulses tempt him to solve the crime with brutal justice. And then there is Dave, who came home the night Jimmy's daughter died covered in someone else's blood.

1471241211,The tenant of Wildfell Hall,Anne Brontë,2013,W F Howes Ltd,Historical Fiction ,"Gilbert Markham is deeply intrigued by Helen Graham, a beautiful and secretive young woman who has moved into nearby Wildfell Hall with her young son. He is quick to offer Helen his friendship, but when her reclusive behaviour becomes the subject of local gossip and speculation, Gilbert begins to wonder what she is hiding. Anne Bronte's second novel seemed to many contemporary readers shockingly unlike her first, Agnes Grey, published in the previous year. There, Charlotte Bronte had admired her sister's 'quiet description and simple pathos', but she was disturbed by The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, which reminded reviewers of Wuthering Heights: it was, in spite of its 'excellent moral', 'coarse, not to say brutal'. For Anne's heroine, Helen Huntingdon, having endured too many of the 'revolting scenes' deplored by reviewers, leaves her dissolute husband in order to earn her own living and rescue her son from his influence. A passionate and courageous challenge to the conventions supposedly upheld by Victorian society and reflected in circulating-library fiction, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is compelling in its imaginative power, in the bold naturalism of its central scenes, the realism and range of its dialogue, and in its psychological insight into the characters involved in the marital battle.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11727014-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11727014-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11727014-L.jpg,nan

He is charmed by Old World fascinations and caught up in the leisurely craft and bohemian direction of European worldliness. An older woman of rank and adventurous but subtle skill, Madame de Vionnet, strokes his ego and does her best to keep Chad in Paris indefinitely. Chad's mother lives in Woollett, Mass., and wants her son to return to run the family business. Mrs. Newsome is an invalid and cannot go to Paris to fetch her son herself, so she employs Lambert Strether and Sarah Pocock to return Chad to Massachusetts. Sarah has been to Paris before and is aware of its attractiveness, so her determination to succeed in this task is fixed and uncompromising. Strether is of later middle age, however, and inspired by the fairytale of a beautiful life in Europe. Mrs. Newsome has promised to marry Strether if he can bring Chad home. Strether is completely enamored by the Parisian character and its enchantments and has a difficult time completing his mission. The drama of reestablishing Chad in business in America and of coming to terms with the mythological romance of France leaves the reader unbalanced, trying to recover equilibrium in the real world. Those involved with Chad's rescue are compelled to recognize the deep intimacies of personal attachment and the accepted proprieties of direct consequence. The success and failures of such an undertaking are unpredictable. The result of every character's attempt to steer Chad rightly is a strange conglomeration of role reversal, fantasy, and truth.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8151763-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8151763-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8151763-L.jpg,nan

Suess writes ""Bronte provides a portrait of the governess that is as sympathetic as her fictional indictment of the shallow, selfish moneyed class is biting."" Anne Bronte relies on her own personal involvement in her duties as a home teacher to bring Agnes Grey to life. Agnes, a rector's daughter, must take employment as a governess to help her family make financial ends meet. But her situations with the spoiled, self-obsessed Bloomfield children and later with the ruthless Murray family forces her into a lonely, humiliating experience that is a wearying one extraordinarily blossoming into a romantic relationship with the local vicar, Edward Weston. Agnes' concern for her family brings her to these unfortunate trials where she suffers stupid and egotistic proprietors and their over-indulged progeny. She was not able to foresee the hardships she would have to undergo along with the class snobbery to which she was also subjected. And yet a career as a governess was the only ""respectable"" job available to an unmarried woman in Victorian England. Bronte's simple and uncomplicated rendition of these sordid affairs made circumstances surrounding such brutish conditions authentic enough to necessitate investigation and improvement.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1464089-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1464089-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1464089-L.jpg,nan

0312195451,Fashionable nonsense,Alan D. Sokal,1998,Picador USA, Fashion ,"""In 1996, Alan Sokal Published an Essay in the hip intellectual magazine Social Text parodying the scientific but impenetrable lingo of contemporary theorists. On the heels of the fierce academic debate that followed the hoax, Sokal teams up with Jean Bricmont to expose the abuse of scientific concepts in the writings of today's most fashionable postmodern thinkers. From Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva to Luce Irigaray and Jean Baudrillard, the authors document the errors made by some postmodernists using science to bolster their arguments and theories. Witty and closely reasoned, Fashionable Nonsense dispels the notion that scientific theories are mere ""narratives"" or social constructions, and explores the abilities and the limits of science to describe the conditions of existence.

1250803985,The Immortality Key,Brian C. Muraresku,"Jan 11, 2022",St. Martin's Griffin,Religion ,"""A groundbreaking, controversial dive into the role psychedelics have played in the human experience of the Divine throughout Western history, and the answer to a 2,000 year old mystery that could shake the Church to its foundations. The Immortality Key connects the lost, psychedelic sacrament of Greek religion to early Christianity-exposing the true origins of Western Civilization. In the tradition of unsolved historical mysteries like David Grann's Killers of the Flower Moon and Douglas Preston's The Lost City of the Monkey God, Brian C. Muraresku's 10-year investigation takes the reader through Greece, Germany, Spain, France and Italy, offering unprecedented access to the hidden archives of the Louvre and the Vatican along the way. In The Immortality Key, Muraresku explores a little-known connection between the best-kept secret in Ancient Greece and Christianity. This is the real story of the most famous human being who ever lived (Jesus) and the biggest religion the world has ever known. Today, 2.4 billion people are Christian. That's one third of the planet. But do any of them really know how it all started? Before Jerusalem, before Rome, before Mecca-there was Eleusis: the spiritual capital of the ancient world. It promised immortality to Plato and the rest of Athens's greatest minds with a very simple formula: drink this potion, see God. Shrouded in secrecy for millennia, the Ancient Greek sacrament was buried when the newly Christianized Roman Empire obliterated Eleusis in the fourth century AD. Renegade scholars in the 1970s claimed the Greek potion was psychedelic, just like the original Christian Eucharist that replaced it. In recent years, vindication for the disgraced theory has been quietly mounting in the laboratory. The rapidly growing field of archaeological chemistry has proven the ancient use of visionary drugs. And with a single dose of psilocybin, the psycho-pharmacologists at Johns Hopkins and NYU are now turning self-proclaimed atheists into instant believers. No one has ever found hard, scientific evidence of drugs connected to Eleusis, let alone early Christianity. Until now. Armed with key documents never before translated into English, convincing analysis, and a captivating spirit of quest, Muraresku mines science, classical literature, biblical scholarship and art to deliver the hidden key to eternal life, bringing us to what clinical psychologist William Richards calls ""the edge of an awesomely vast frontier.""

0804830568,"Buddhism, the religion of no-religion",Alan Watts,1996,C.E. Tuttle,Religion ,"In this dynamic series of lectures recorded in 1965 and 1969, Alan Watts joyfully takes us on an exploration of Buddhism, from its roots in India over 2,500 years ago to the explosion of interest in Zen and the Tibetan tradition in the West.
These lectures have been transcribed and edited by the author's son, Mark Watts, who also provides an introduction that sets them in their historical context. This book then begins with Journey From India, which presents a brief explanation of the Indian worldview and cosmology followed by a discussion of the important differences between Hinduism and Buddhism.
The Middle Way offers an insight into the radical methods of the Mahayana, or ""great vehicle,"" and reviews the basic Buddhist terms and teaching, including the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Alan Watts then turns his attention to Zen and Tibetan Buddhism in the remaining four chapters. In Religion of No-Religion he discusses how the Buddha taught the method of awakening through the experience of no-self, no-concept, and no-religion. This technique of short-circuiting the mind is seen today in the method of instruction centered upon Zen koans.
In contrast to the intellectual methods of Zen, the Tibetan, or Vajrayana school, retained much more of the original Indian flavor of Mahayana Buddhism, and in Wisdom of the Mountains Watts provides an introduction to Tibetan Buddhism by explaining its unique practices. In the final chapter, Transcending Duality, Alan Watts explores the male and female symbolism of Tantric yoga and explores the unity of polar opposites as a form of resonance.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/578624-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/578624-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/578624-L.jpg,nan

These ""queer spaces"" reflect the experiences of homosexuals in a straight culture.
Often forced to hide their true nature, gay men and women have turned inward, playing with the norms of interior space and creating environments of stagecraft and celebration where they can define themselves without fear.

But it's okay -- Liz has a plan that will get her out of Campbell, Indiana, forever: attend the uber-elite Pennington College, play in their world-famous orchestra, and become a doctor.
But when the financial aid she was counting on unexpectedly falls through, Liz's plans come crashing down ... until she's reminded of her school's scholarship for prom king and queen. There's nothing Liz wants to do less than endure a gauntlet of social media trolls, catty competitors, and humiliating public events, but despite her devastating fear of the spotlight she's willing to do whatever it takes to get to Pennington.The only thing that makes it halfway bearable is the new girl in school, Mack. She's smart, funny, and just as much of an outsider as Liz. But Mack is also in the running for queen.

9681642562,Breve historia de los Estados Unidos,Allan Nevins,1994,Fondo de Cultura Económica,Short Stories ,"Esta Breve historia de los Estados Unidos permite al lector seguir paso a paso, con amenidad y profundidad, el tránsito del pueblo estadounidense desde aquella mañana de abril de 1607 en que tres naves inglesas anclaron en Chesapeake y desembarcaron los primeros colonos, hasta la presidencia de George Bush, en un mundo ya radicalmente distinto, diferencia que no debe poco precisamente a los hechos aquí relatados.
Los Estados Unidos son una nación singular. En su breve historia han llegado a convertirse en la primera potencia mundial. Los sucesos que han marcado este vertiginoso ascenso son fruto de un espíritu vigoroso que encarna en aquellos pioneros que sometieron a fuerza de trabajo y esfuerzo personal un vastísimo territorio, y en los estadounidenses de hoy, que reafirman en la vida nacional su individualidad y su valor personal frente a cualquier intento de sujeción.
Los autores agrupan los acontecimientos nacionales según cada periodo presidencial, estrategia que ayuda mucho a imprimirle a esta obra un claro tinte didáctico. Nada importante de la vida estadounidense escapa al análisis crítico de los autores: la injusticia hacia los negros, los descalabros de la política exterior, el desastre de la guerra de Vietnam, los rasgos positivos y negativos de cada uno de sus líderes, el análisis de las grandes empresas o la ingenuidad de los planteamientos políticos anticomunistas.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12060679-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12060679-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12060679-L.jpg,nan

Antes del alba darán conmigo y me encerrarán en una celda negra, donde languideceré interminablemente, mientras insaciables deseos roen mis entrañas y consumen mi corazón, hasta ser al fin uno con los muertos que amo.
Mi asiento es la fétida fosa de una vetusta tumba; mi pupitre, el envés de una lápida caída y desgastada por los siglos implacables; mi única luz es la de las estrellas y la de una angosta media luna, aunque puedo ver tan claramente como si fuera mediodía. A mi alrededor, como sepulcrales centinelas guardando descuidadas tumbas, las inclinadas y decrépitas lápidas yacen medio ocultas por masas de nauseabunda maleza en descomposición. Y sobre todo, perfilándose contra el enfurecido cielo, un solemne monumento alza su austero chapitel ahusado, semejando el espectral caudillo de una horda fantasmal. El aire está enrarecido por el nocivo olor de los hongos y el hedor de la húmeda tierra mohosa, pero para mí es el aroma del Elíseo. Todo es quietud - terrorífica quietud -, con un silencio cuya intensidad promete lo solemne y lo espantoso.
De haber podido elegir mi morada, lo hubiera hecho en alguna ciudad de carne en descomposición y huesos que se deshacen, pues su proximidad brinda a mi alma escalofríos de éxtasis, acelerando la estancada sangre en mis venas y forzando a latir mi lánguido corazón con júbilo delirante… ¡Porque la presencia de la muerte es vida para mí!» (de Los amados muertos).",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1048045-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1048045-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1048045-L.jpg,nan

9681210050,El aleph,Jorge Luis Borges,2001,El Colegio de México,Spanish ,"In Borges' story, the Aleph is a point in space that contains all other points. Anyone who gazes into it can see everything in the universe from every angle simultaneously, without distortion, overlapping, or confusion. The story traces the theme of infinity found in several of Borges' other works, such as ""The Book of Sand"". As in many of Borges' short stories, the protagonist is a fictionalized version of the author. At the beginning of the story, he is mourning the recent death of a woman whom he loved, named Beatriz Viterbo, and resolves to stop by the house of her family to pay his respects. Over time, he comes to know her first cousin, Carlos Argentino Daneri, a mediocre poet with a vastly exaggerated view of his own talent who has made it his lifelong quest to write an epic poem that describes every single location on the planet in excruciatingly fine detail. Later in the story, a business on the same street attempts to tear down Daneri's house in the course of its expansion. Daneri becomes enraged, explaining to the narrator that he must keep the house in order to finish his poem, because the cellar contains an Aleph which he is using to write the poem. Though by now he believes Daneri to be quite insane, the narrator proposes without waiting for an answer to come to the house and see the Aleph for himself. Left alone in the darkness of the cellar, the narrator begins to fear that Daneri is conspiring to kill him, and then he sees the Aleph for himself: ""On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbearable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realised that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe. I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid; I saw a splintered labyrinth (it was London); I saw, close up, unending eyes watching themselves in me as in a mirror; I saw all the mirrors on earth and none of them reflected me; I saw in a backyard of Soler Street the same tiles that thirty years before I'd seen in the entrance of a house in Fray Bentos; I saw bunches of grapes, snow, tobacco, lodes of metal, steam; I saw convex equatorial deserts and each one of their grains of sand..."" Though staggered by the experience of seeing the Aleph, the narrator pretends to have seen nothing in order to get revenge on Daneri, whom he dislikes, by giving Daneri a reason to doubt his own sanity. The narrator tells Daneri that he has lived too long amongst the noise and bustle of the city and spent too much time in the dark and enclosed space of his cellar, and assures him that what he truly needs are the wide open spaces and fresh air of the countryside, and these will provide him the true peace of mind that he needs to complete his poem. He then takes his leave of Daneri and exits the house. In a postscript to the story, Borges explains that Daneri's house was ultimately demolished, but that Daneri himself won second place for the Argentine National Prize for Literature. He also states his belief that the Aleph in Daneri's house was not the only one that exists, based on a report he has discovered, written by ""Captain Burton"" (Richard Francis Burton) when he was British consul in Brazil, describing the Mosque of Amr in Cairo, within which there is said to be a stone pillar that contains the entire universe; although this Aleph cannot be seen, it is said that those who put their ear to the pillar can hear a continuous hum that symbolises all the concurrent noises of the universe heard at any given time. - Wikipedia.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13441504-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13441504-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13441504-L.jpg,nan

0060172533,Paula,Isabel Allende,1995,HarperCollins Publishers,Spanish ,"Paula is a soul-baring memoir, which, like a novel of suspense, one reads without drawing a breath. The point of departure for these moving pages is a tragic personal experience. In December 1991, Isabel Allende's daughter, Paula, became gravely ill and shortly thereafter fell into a coma. During months in the hospital, the author began to write the story of her family for her unconscious daughter.
In the telling, bizarre ancestors appear before our eyes; we hear both delightful and bitter childhood memories, amazing anecdotes of youthful years, the most intimate secrets passed along in whispers. Chile, Allende's native land, comes alive as well, with the turbulent history of the military coup of 1973, the ensuing dictatorship, and her family's years of exile.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10665822-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10665822-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10665822-L.jpg,nan

0486290271,The Island of Dr. Moreau,H. G. Wells,1996,Dover Publications,English ,"Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.
While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311919-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311919-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311919-L.jpg,nan

   Writing in an age when the call for the rights of man had brought revolution to America and France, Mary Wollstonecraft produced her own declaration of female independence in 1792. Passionate and forthright, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman attacked the prevailing view of docile, decorative femininity, and instead laid out the principles of emancipation: an equal education for girls and boys, an end to prejudice, and for women to become defined by their profession, not their partner. Mary Wollstonecraft's work was received with a mixture of admiration and outrage - Walpole called her 'a hyena in petticoats' - yet it established her as the mother of modern feminism.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311925-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311925-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/311925-L.jpg,nan

Passengers awake to find the train still stranded and to discover that a wealthy American has been brutally stabbed to death in his private compartment. Incredibly, that compartment is locked from the inside. With no escape into the wintery landscape the killer must still be on board. Fortunately, the brilliant Belgian inspector Hercule Poirot is also on board, having booked the last available berth.
Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie’s most famous novels, owing no doubt to a combination of its romantic setting and the ingeniousness of its plot; its non-exploitative reference to the sensational kidnapping and murder of the infant son of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh only two years prior; and a popular 1974 film adaptation, starring Albert Finney as Poirot - one of the few cinematic versions of a Christie work that met with the approval, however mild, of the author herself.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12902763-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12902763-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12902763-L.jpg,nan

Avoiding geographical bias, the authors provide summaries of ‘Enlightenment’, ‘Romantic’ and ‘Victorian’ anthropology, from the cultural theories of Morgan and Taylor to the often neglected contributions of German scholars. The ambiguous relationship between anthropology and national cultures is also considered, and the growth of distinctive national styles in anthropological research is highlighted.
A History of Anthropology is an unparalleled account of theoretical developments in anthropology from the 1920s to the present, including functionalism, structuralism, hermeneutics, neo-Marxism and discourse analysis. Major anthropologists are provided with brief biographies and key debates are covered such as those concerning totemism, kinship and globalisation.

Storm, a handsome chef, claims to have a secret weapon: an aphrodisiac menu that her patrons won't be able to resist. It certainly works on Abby – who gives in to the passions she has denied herself for years. But can this playboy chef really be Abby's hero if her body means more to him than her heart, and his initial plan was to steal the restaurant from under her nose? Storm soon turns the restaurant around, but Abby's insatiable desires have taken over her life. She's never known a guy into crazy sex like him before, and she wants to spend every spare moment getting as much intense erotic pleasure as she can. Meanwhile, her best friend Marissa becomes suspicious of the new wonder-boy in the kitchen. Before things get really out of control, someone has to assume responsibility. But can Abby tear herself away from the object of her lustful attention long enough to see what's really going on?",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/213932-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/213932-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/213932-L.jpg,nan

0060282975,Stuart Little,E. B. White,1999,HarperCollins Publishers,Picture Books ,"This is the first children's book by the distinguished author E.B. White. Stuart Little, the hero, is a mouse in the family of Frederick C. Little and is a debonair little character with a shy, engaging manner and a somewhat philosophical turn of mind. He is a great help around the house, and everybody except Snowbell the cat likes him a great deal. In spite of his small size, Stuart gets around in the world, riding a Fifth Avenue bus, racing (and winning in) a sailboat in Central Park, teaching school for a day, and so on. His size--just over two inches--does give him some trouble now and then, like the time he was rolled up in the window shade, or when he got dumped into a garbage scow. But on the whole his life is a happy one. His great adventure comes when, at the age of seven, he sets out in the world to seek his dearest friend, Margalo, a beautiful little bird who stayed for a few days in the Littles' Boston fern. It is on this search that we leave Stuart, going north in his little car, sure he is heading in the right direction.
In this special gift-book edition of a beloved classic, renowned artist Rosemeary Wells has lovingly added delicate watercolor to the original black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams. Stuart Little, small in size only, has the indomitable spirit of a heroic figure, and his story, funny and tender and exciting by turns,  will be read, reread, and love by young and old.

Life could become a summer afternoon, a slow swim in a warm lake. I could become another backyard roustabout, part of the greedy gang eying the vegetable garden. The larcenous woodchuck returns.

A sensual and protected young woman, the narrator grows up in the lush, natural world of the Caribbean. She is sold into marriage to the cold-hearted and prideful Rochester, who succumbs to his need for money and his lust. Yet he will make her pay for her ancestors' sins of slaveholding, excessive drinking and nihilistic despair by enslaving her as a prisoner in his bleak British home.

Alfred, the patriarch, is a distant, puritanical company man; he is also slipping into Parkinson's-induced dementia. His wife, Enid, is a model Midwestern housewife, at once deferential and controlling. Their three children--Gary, an uptight banker, baffled by his own persistent unhappiness; Chip, and ex-professor now failing as a screenwriter; and Denise, and up-and-coming chief in a hot new restaurant--have little time for Enid and Alfred. But when Enid calls for one last Christmas at the family home, the trajectories of five American lifetimes converge.

Two, ""The Adulterous Woman"" and ""The Renegade"" take the deserts for their scenes; its barrenness brings revelation to Janine, madness to the renegade missionary. In ""The Artist At Work"" he elucidates the encumbrance and distraction which love entails and the failure in flight from love. ""The Silent Men"" and ""The Guest"" are stoic statements for compassion, for no other reason than for men's need to draw comfort from one another.

It begins with Michael Henchard, a young hay-trusser, drunk on rum, auctioning off his wife and baby daughter at a village fair. The next day, overcome with remorse, Henchard resolves to turn his life around. When we meet Henchard eighteen years later, temperance and hard work have made him wealthy and respectable. However, he cannot escape his past. His secret guilt, his pride, and his impulsive temper all serve to sabotage his good name.The Mayor of Casterbridge was published in 1886, first as a magazine serial and then later that year as a book. It is perhaps most noteworthy for the psychological portrait of Michael Henchard, a tragic character who remains sympathetic while simultaneously being deeply flawed. Typical of other Hardy novels, it also vividly depicts life in the rural countryside at that time.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12216177-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12216177-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12216177-L.jpg,nan

A sign hanging around his neck said, ""Please look after this bear. Thank you"" So that is just what they did.
From the very first night when he attempted his first bath and ended up nearly flooding the house, Paddington was seldom far from imminent disaster. Jonathan and Judy were delighted with this havoc and even Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to admit that life seemed to be more filled with adventure when there was a bear in the house.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/393532-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/393532-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/393532-L.jpg,nan

Therefore, besides giving students a thorough grounding in the theory of waves and vibrations, the book also demonstrates the pattern and unity of a large part of physics.  This new edition has been thoroughly revised and has been redeisgned to meet the best contemporary standards. It includes new material on electron waves in solids using the Kronig-Penney model to show how their allowed energies are limited to Brillouin zones, The role of phonons is also discussed. An Optical Transform is used to demonstrate the modern method of lens testing. In the last two chapters the sections on chaos and solitons have been reduced but their essential contents remain.  As with earlier editions, the book has a large number of problems together with hints on how to solve them. The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, 6th Edition will prove invaluable for students taking a first full course in the subject across a variety of disciplines particularly physics, engineering and mathematics.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9285615-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9285615-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9285615-L.jpg,nan

His observations on the geological and mineral ogical character of the regions through which he passed, his notes on botany, on the nature of the soil and on meth ods of tillage, his researches in history and archeology, are too technical to be either interesting or profitable to the student. His comments on art on the pictures, the stat ues, the edifices that he saw are also for the most part not of general interest.

It demonstrates why outstanding companies that had their competitive antennae up, listened astutely to customers, and invested aggressively in new technologies still lost their market leadership when confronted with disruptive changes in technology and market structure. And it tells how to avoid a similar fate.
Using the lessons of successes and failures of leading companies, The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. These principles will help managers determine when it is right not to listen to customers, when to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins, and when to pursue small markets at the expense of seemingly larger and more lucrative ones.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9274687-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9274687-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9274687-L.jpg,nan

Talese/Doubleday,Italian ,"From the pen of a master -- the #1 bestselling, Booker Prize--winning author of Atonement -- comes an astonishing novel that captures the fine balance of happiness and the unforeseen threats that can destroy it. A brilliant, thrilling page-turner that will keep readers on the edge of their seats.Saturday is a masterful novel set within a single day in February 2003. Henry Perowne is a contented man -- a successful neurosurgeon, happily married to a newspaper lawyer, and enjoying good relations with his children. Henry wakes to the comfort of his large home in central London on this, his day off. He is as at ease here as he is in the operating room. Outside the hospital, the world is not so easy or predictable. There is an impending war against Iraq, and a general darkening and gathering pessimism since the New York and Washington attacks two years before.On this particular Saturday morning, Perowne's day moves through the ordinary to the extraordinary. After an unusual sighting in the early morning sky, he makes his way to his regular squash game with his anaesthetist, trying to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marchers filling the streets of London, protesting against the war. A minor accident in his car brings him into a confrontation with a small-time thug. To Perowne's professional eye, something appears to be profoundly wrong with this young man, who in turn believes the surgeon has humiliated him -- with savage consequences that will lead Henry Perowne to deploy all his skills to keep his family alive.From the Hardcover edition.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10541507-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10541507-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10541507-L.jpg,nan

0132350882,Clean Code,Robert C. Martin,July 2008,Prentice Hall,Italian ,"Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way.
Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer but only if you work at it.
What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.
Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and ""smells"" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

0060956585,The path to the spiders' nests,Italo Calvino,2000,Ecco Press,Italian ,"""Italo Calvino was only twenty-three when he first published this bold and imaginative novel. It tells the story of Pin, a cobbler's apprentice in a town on the Ligurian coast during World War II. He lives with his sister, a prostitute and spends as much time as he can at a seedy bar where he amuses the adult patrons. After a mishap with a Nazi soldier, Pin becomes involved with a band of partisans.
Calvino's portrayal of these characters, seen through the eyes of a child, is not only a revealing commentary on the Italian resistance but an insightful coming-of-age story.
Updated to include changes from Calvino's definitive Italian edition, previously censored passages, and his newly translated, unabridged preface - in which Calvino brilliantly critiques and places into historical context his own youthful work - The Path to the Spiders' Nests is animated by the formidable imagination that has made Italo Calvino one of the most respected writers of our time.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9541441-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9541441-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9541441-L.jpg,nan

Terran greed spirals around native innocence & wisdom, overturning the ancient society.
Humans have learned interstellar travel from the Hainish (the origin-planet of all humanoid races, including Athsheans). Various planets have been expanding independently, but during the novel it’s learned that the League of All Worlds has been formed. News arrives via an ansible, a new discovery. Previously they had been cut off, 27 light years from home.
The story occurs after The Dispossessed, where both the ansible & the League of Worlds are unrealised. Also well before Planet of Exile, where human settlers have learned to coexist. The 24th century has been suggested.
Terran colonists take over the planet locals call Athshe, meaning “forest,” rather than “dirt,” like their home planet Terra. They follow the 19th century model of colonization: felling trees, planting farms, digging mines & enslaving indigenous peoples. The natives are unequipped to comprehend this. They’re a subsistence race who rely on the forests & have no cultural precedent for tyranny, slavery or war.

160444357X,Last and first men,Olaf Stapledon,2011,Indo-European Publishing,Science ,"One of the most succinct and accurate renderings of mankind's present state of mind and future progression. It documents the future of man from the start of WW2 and continues until the Sun engulfs the earth, and beyond. Considering this book was first published in 1931, it is remarkable, both in its honesty as regards human nature, and in its phenomenal span. By the time we reach chapter 3 of the 16 in this book, it is already 2300 AD and you feel like you have had the viewpoint of a God. So intense is the writing, that a few pages can take you hours to read and weeks to think about. What a writer, what a visionary. Of particular interest to me was the laconic way he can sum up an entire country's culture and people, and the accuracy of prediction in the first part of the book.
Points to note :-
All budding politicians should be forced to read this book. It should be part of any politics curriculum.
   Strikingly accurate and plausible portent of homo sapiens future. Read in the context of 2002, it is easy to see mankind's current folly and the extrapolation of current scientific endeavours. For example, we may achieve global peace (""An Americanised Planet"""") for a few millennia, but at the cost of spiritual and intellectual freedom and development. When the ""Fall of the First Men"" happened, recovery took a very long time :-
""Later, when the epidemic was spent, even though civilisation was already in ruins, a concerted effort of devotion might yet have rebuilt it on a more modest plan. But among the First Men, only a minority had ever been capable of wholehearted devotion. The great majority were by nature too much obsessed by private impulses.""
Sounds like the malaise of current homo sapiens.
The theme of continual physical exertion and constant movement of attention as an underpinning for the lifestyles of all successful social inhabitants was beautifully described. This is so true of today's and future societies. No pause for reflection or contemplation. The abandonment of philosophy as a science in the future. The pig-headed clinging to pagan artefact or idol worship, rather than logic.
The brilliant description of the ""Second Men"", with his finer array of senses, and his natural propensity for altruism.
The plausible evolution of intelligent life on Mars in 10 million years time, with the subsequent misunderstanding of what is intelligent between Earth and Mars.
Man's creation of more evolved forms of man meshes brilliantly with current genetic research.
""Time travel"" achieved by mental regression into past minds. The future remains unknown.
Conclusions :-
Apply common sense to the situation as it is now, to work out the best course of action. Never invoke traditions or old beliefs as these threaten your survival in an ever-changing environment.
Within the same species, organisms are equally complex biochemically. Therefore, any social structure that imposes arbitrary division within the species, is intrinsically flawed. This is true of current homo sapiens organisation, where certain people are far more highly regarded than others for stupid reasons, and divisions between cliques of people usually erupt in violence, rather than heated debate.
Just because someone cannot be convinced of your way of seeing things, doesn't mean that physical coercion becomes necessary.
""Live and let live"" doesn't mean live it up and let the rest live in squalor.
Nothing should be regarded as taboo, save that which is unnatural.
There are absolutely no restrictions on what anyone can think.

6073131011,Plegarias atendidas,Truman Capote,2015,Debols!llo,Women ,"RESUMEN: El protagonista de la novela ingenioso, encantador, bisexual, absolutamente amoral logró escaparse de un orfanato a los trece años, aprendió el oficio de masajista y se las ingenió para convertirse en un pícaro moderno y codearse con los ricos y los famosos, desempeñando unas veces el papel de confidente, otras el de bufón y, para los lectores de esta novela, el de divertidísimo cronista de las disparatadas vidas de la jet-set. Este libro es, en buena parte, un roman à clef y, a veces, ni siquiera necesita claves, pues por sus páginas desfilan junto a retratos tenuemente disfrazados de escritores como Tennessee Williams, actrices como Greta Garbo, millonarios como Niarchos, personajes reales, como las inefables Mrs. Mathau y Mrs. Cooper, cuyos diálogos sobre la vida y costumbres (preferentemente sexuales) de otros miembros de la alta sociedad están reproducidos con cruel fidelidad.
Although Truman Capote's last, unfinished novel offers a devastating group portrait of the high and low society of his time. Tracing the career of a writer of uncertain parentage and omnivorous erotic tastes, Answered Prayers careens from a louche bar in Tangiers to a banquette at La Côte Basque, from literary salons to high-priced whorehouses. It takes in calculating beauties and sadistic husbands along with such real-life supporting characters as Colette, the Duchess of Windsor, Montgomery Clift, and Tallulah Bankhead.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14843378-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14843378-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14843378-L.jpg,nan

8417517669,Ellas hablan,Miriam Toews,"Feb 24, 2020",Editorial Sexto Piso,Women ,"One evening, eight Mennonite women climb into a hay loft to conduct a secret meeting. For the past two years, each of these women, and more than a hundred other girls in their colony, has been repeatedly violated in the night by demons coming to punish them for their sins. Now that the women have learned they were in fact drugged and attacked by a group of men from their own community, they are determined to protect themselves and their daughters from future harm. While the men of the colony are off in the city, attempting to raise enough money to bail out the rapists and bring them home, these women-all illiterate, without any knowledge of the world outside their community and unable even to speak the language of the country they live in-have very little time to make a choice: Should they stay in the only world they've ever known or should they dare to escape? Based on real events and told through the ""minutes"" of the women's all-female symposium, Toews's masterful novel uses wry, politically engaged humor to relate this tale of women claiming their own power to decide.--

0140101691,The female malady,Elaine Showalter,1987,Penguin Books,Women ,"In this informative, timely and often harrowing study, Elaine Showalter demonstrates how cultural ideas about 'proper' feminine behaviour have shaped the definition and treatment of female insanity for 150 years, and given mental disorder in women specifically sexual connotations. Along with vivid portraits of the men who dominated psychiatry, and descriptions of the therapeutic practices that were used to bring women 'to their senses', she draws on diaries and narratives by inmates, and fiction from Mary Wollstonecraft to Doris Lessing, to supply a cultural perspective usually missing from studies of mental illness.
Highly original and beautifully written, The Female Malady is a vital counter-interpretation of madness in women, showing how it is a consequence of, rather than a deviation from, the traditional female role.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15152554-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15152554-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15152554-L.jpg,nan

0060176512,The escape artist,Diane Chamberlain,1997,HarperCollinsPublishers,Artists ,"Susanna Miller may have lost legal custody of her beautiful eleven-month-old son, Tyler, but that doesn't mean she is giving him up. Even if her ex-husband, Jim, an attorney, and his new wife, Peggy, have every advantage to offer a child, Susanna knows the two of them cannot be as caring, loving, and devoted as she has been.
Defying a court order to give Tyler to his father, Susanna runs away, seeking a new start for her child and herself. She changes her name, dyes her hair, and leaves Boulder, Colorado, without a word to anyone, not even the man she loved before she knew Jim. Linc Sebastian has been her best friend since childhood. Linc knows Susanna better than anyone.
But she can't risk his help now. Two thousand miles from home, she seeks anonymity in the lovely eastern town of Annapolis, Maryland. Lonely, frightened, and unsure of whom to trust, she meets Adam, a troubled local artist with secrets in his own past. Although drawn by his kindness, she cannot forget Linc and the special love they will always share, even if they never see each other again.
As she tries to forget her past, Susanna discovers that starting a new life is more dangerous than she thought, and that the unpredictable has an alarming way of working itself into your world.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12745265-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12745265-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12745265-L.jpg,nan

0394546644,Edward Hopper,Gail Levin,1995,Knopf,Artists ,"In the art of Edward Hopper (1882-1967), tense, unhappy men and women, in whom we recognize something of our neighbors and ourselves, play out mysterious dramas in silent, stripped-down spaces - stages raked by an unrelenting and revealing light. These paintings, and Hopper's equally evocative landscapes and houses, make us wonder: what kind of man had this haunting vision, and what kind of life engendered this art? No one is better qualified to answer these questions than the art historian Gail Levin, author of the major studies of Hopper's work (including the catalogue raisonne) and curator of many exhibitions that explored his development and cultural context. Delving deeply into his art and into a rich archive of unpublished letters and diaries, she now constructs ""An Intimate Biography,"" which reveals the true nature and personality of the man himself - and of the woman who shared his life and helped to shape his art.
Jo Hopper's diaries permit an intimate look at the interactions of an indissolubly bonded couple, revealing for the first time the personal tensions that lie behind some of Hopper's most haunting works. Gail Levin, sifting the gritty reality of Jo's story with her own analytic skills and historical and literary knowledge, uses the diaries to great effect in linking specific paintings to the time, place, and mood in which they were created.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/253759-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/253759-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/253759-L.jpg,nan

Today its message has grown more relevent than ever before.
Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodoties, the printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television “family.” But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.
This sixtieth-anniversary edition commemorates Ray Bradbury's masterpiece with a new introduction by Neil Baiman; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Nelson Algren. Harold Bloom, Margaret Atwood, and others: rare manuscript pages and sketches from ""Ray Bradbury's personal archive and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.

0415459206,Foundations of Entrepreneurship and Economic Development,David A. Harper,"September 17, 2007",Routledge,Entrepreneurship ,"Entrepreneurship is a key factor in economic development. It determines how quickly and accurately an economic system identifies and responds to the profit opportunities inherent in disequilibrium situations.This well-written book is the first to deal with entrepreneurship in all its aspects. It considers the economic, psychological, political, legal and cultural dimensions of entrepreneurship from a market-process perspective. David A Harper has produced a volume that analyses why some people are quicker than others in discovering profit opportunities. Importantly, the book also covers the issue of how cultural value systems orient entrepreneurial vision and in contrast to conventional wisdom, the book argues that individualist cultural values are not categorically superior to group oriented values in terms of their consequences for entrepreneurial discovery.This stimulating and original book will be of great interest to development and market economists as well as their students. The policy implications for economic institutions that Harper concludes with will also make the book important reading for those working in the public sector.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2415341-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2415341-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/2415341-L.jpg,nan

0691048029,"Men, women, and chain saws",Carol J. Clover,1992,Princeton University Press, Film ,"Do the pleasures of horror movies really begin and end in sadism? So the public discussion of film assumes, and so film theory claims. According to that view, the power of films like Halloween and Texas Chain Saw Massacre lies in their ability to yoke us in the killer's perspective and to make us party to his atrocities. In this book Carol Clover argues that sadism is actually the lesser part of the horror experience and that the movies work mainly to engage the viewer in the plight of the victim-hero - the figure who suffers pain and fright but eventually rises to vanquish the forces of oppression. A paradox is that, since the late 1970s, the victim-hero is usually female and the audience predominantly male.
It is the fraught relation between the ""tough girl"" of horror and her male fan that Clover explores. Horror movies, she concludes, use female bodies not only for the male spectator to feel at, but for him to feel through.
The author concentrates on three genres in which women and gender issues loom especially large: slasher films, satanic possession films, and rape-revenge films, especially those in which the victim is from the city and the rapists from the country. Her investigation covers over two hundred films, ranging from admired mainstream examples, such as The Accused, to such exploitation products as the widely banned I Spit on Your Grave. Clover emphasizes the importance of the ""low"" tradition in filmmaking, arguing that it has provided some of the most significant artistic and political innovations of the past two decades.
Female-hero films like Silence of the Lambs and Thelma and Louise may be breakthroughs from the point of view of mainstream Hollywood cinema, but their themes have a long ancestry in lowlife horror.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/441442-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/441442-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/441442-L.jpg,nan

Mi-ja and Young-sook, two girls living on the Korean island of Jeju, are best friends that come from very different backgrounds. When they are old enough, they begin working in the sea with their village's all-female diving collective, led by Young-sook's mother. As the girls take up their positions as baby divers, they know they are beginning a life of excitement and responsibility but also danger. Despite their love for each other, Mi-ja and Young-sook's differences are impossible to ignore. The Island of Sea Women is an epoch set over many decades, beginning during a period of Japanese colonialism in the 1930s and 1940s, followed by World War II, the Korean War and its aftermath, through the era of cell phones and wet suits for the women divers. Throughout this time, the residents of Jeju find themselves caught between warring empires. Mi-ja is the daughter of a Japanese collaborator, and she will forever be marked by this association. Young-sook was born into a long line of haenyeo and will inherit her mother's position leading the divers in their village. Little do the two friends know that after surviving hundreds of dives and developing the closest of bonds, forces outside their control will push their friendship to the breaking point. This beautiful, thoughtful novel illuminates a world turned upside down, one where the women are in charge, engaging in dangerous physical work, and the men take care of the children. A classic Lisa See story--one of women's friendships and the larger forces that shape them--The Island of Sea Women introduces readers to the fierce and unforgettable female divers of Jeju Island and the dramatic history that shaped their lives""--

0609609521,When the elephants dance,Tess Uriza Holthe,2002,Crown, Dance ,"""When the Elephants Dance is set in the waning days of World War II, as the Japanese and the Americans engage in a fierce battle for possession of the Philippine Islands. The Karangalan family and their neighbors huddle for survival in the cellar of a house a few miles from Manila.
Outside the safety of their little refuge the war rages on - fiery bombs torch the beautiful Filipino countryside, Japanese soldiers round up and interrogate innocent people, and from the hills guerillas wage a desperate campaign against the enemy. Inside the cellar, these men, women, and children put their hopes and dreams on hold as they wait out the war, only emerging to look for food, water, and medicine."".
""Through the eyes of three narrators, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan, his spirited older sister Isabelle, and Domingo, a passionate guerilla commander, we see how ordinary people must learn to live in the midst of extraordinary uncertainty, how they must find hope for survival where none seems to exist. They find this hope in the dramatic history of the Philippine Islands and the passion and bravery of its people.
Crowded together in the cellar, the Karangalans and their friends and neighbors tell magical stories to one another based on Filipino myth and legend to fuel their courage, pass the time, and teach important lessons. The group is held spellbound by these stories, which feature a dazzling array of ghosts, witches, supernatural creatures, and courageous Filipinos who changed the course of history with their actions.
These profoundly moving stories transport the listeners from the chaos of the war around them and give them new resolve to fight on.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/390717-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/390717-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/390717-L.jpg,nan

The book will be visually arresting, exciting to read and an inspiring fashion bible. Charting the incidents and ideas that changed the way women dress, it gives a unique perspective on the history of twentieth-century fashion.

9780802128478,Finance Curse,Nicholas Shaxson,2019,"Grove/Atlantic, Incorporated",Finance ,"""Financial journalist Nicholas Shaxson first made his reputation as a war reporter studying the 'resource curse,' seeing first-hand the disastrous economic and societal effects that followed the discovery of oil in Angola. He then gained prominence as an expert on tax havens, revealing the dark corners of that world long before the scandals of the Panama and Paradise Papers. Now, in The Finance Curse, revised with chapters exclusive to the American edition, he brings his broad knowledge to bear in an eye-opening investigation of how finance has overbalanced the economies of Western democracies, exerting an outsize effect on policy-making and effecting a brain drain of the brightest and best to the financial industry and its offshoots, much to the detriment of both the business sector and broader society. Shaxson explores the transmogrification of banks over the twentieth century from relatively small institutions that did well for themselves by serving the needs of business to unfettered global behemoths. These megabanks now spread the fiscal gospel that business must be taxed as little as possible to achieve unconstrained profits. It has encouraged a race to the bottom between states to provide the most subsidized environment for big business that rides on the toil and taxes of everyone else, all in the name of a bogus 'competitiveness.' We need strong financial institutions-but when finance grows too big it becomes a curse. The Finance Curse is the explosive story of how finance got a stranglehold on society and provides powerful new insights into how we might release ourselves from its grasp. It is a book that none of us can afford to ignore""--",https:/images/icons/avatar_booS.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booM.png,https:/images/icons/avatar_booL.png,nan

With two introductions, from Cindy Sheehan and Ron Kovic, that attempt to place the novel in the context of more recent armed conflicts in both Iraq and Vietnam, it is the better part of a disc before the book properly begins. Once it does, though, the slog ceases. Trumbo's novel is spine-tingling in its immediacy and horror, and William Dufris (while occasionally fumbling around in his bag of voices) mostly gives the words room to breathe. For this book, little more is necessary.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14854011-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14854011-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14854011-L.jpg,nan

Mallory Quinn is fresh out of rehab when she takes a job as a babysitter for Ted and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy.
Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body.
Then, Teddy’s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures quickly evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old. Mallory begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force.
Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher the images and save Teddy before it’s too late.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12775985-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12775985-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12775985-L.jpg,nan

155111111X,The odd women,George Gissing,1998,Broadview Press,Women ,"Five odd women—women without husbands—are the subject of this powerful novel, graphically set in Victorian London, by a writer whose perceptions about people, particularly women, would be remarkable in any age and are extraordinary in the 1890's. The story concerns the choices that five different women make or are forced to make, and what those choices imply about men's and women's place in society and relationship to each other.
Alice and Virginia Madden, suddenly left adrift by the death of their improvident father, must take grinding and humiliating ""genteel"" work. Pretty, vulnerable, and terrified of sharing their fate, their younger sister Monica accepts a proposal of marriage from a man who gives her financial security but drives her to reckless action by his insane jealousy.
Interwoven with their fortunes are Mary Barfoot and Rhoda Nunn, who are dedicating their lives to training young women for independent and useful lives, for emotional as well as economic freedom. Feminine and spirited, they are seeking not to overthrow men but to free both sexes from everything that distorts or depletes their humanity—including, if necessary, marriage. Into their lives comes Mary's engaging and forceful cousin Everard Barfoot, and as he and Rhoda become locked in an increasingly significant and passionate struggle, Rhoda finds out through the refining fire what ""love"" sometimes means, and what it means to be true to herself.

Michael Palin, also a Python alumnus, claims the book is a combination of the Magna Carta and ""Valley of the Dolls"".  Python member Eric Idle claims that it took four people for one comedian to claim to have completed the project.  Chapman himself claims on page 80 that although ""the names have been kept the same, the facts have been altered..."".   Appearing first in 1990 (the back cover blurb claims 1980 on an edition that clearly notes 1990 in the copyright credits) and reprinted several times since then, this is probably NOT an autobiography.

From the first story, about two children making sales calls with their father during the Depression and turning off the road they're traveling on to visit one of his old girlfriends, we know we've entered the magic of ""Alice Munro country"" - a world of passionate and often hidden loves, betrayals, family secrets, and unspoken sympathies, a world that encompasses big cities as well as the area of farms, small towns, and resorts around Lake Huron.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8363509-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8363509-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8363509-L.jpg,nan

He is the originator of the Precrime System, which uses ""precogs""--People with the power to see into the future--to identify criminals before they can do any harm. Unfortunately for Anderton, his precogs perceive him as the next criminal. But Anderton knows he has never contemplated such a thing, and this knowledge proves the precogs are fallible. Now, whichever way he turns, Anderton is doomed--unless he can find the precogs's ""minority report""--the dissenting voice that represents his one hope of getting at the truth in time to save himself from his own system.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/226833-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/226833-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/226833-L.jpg,nan

0679436995,The city and the pillar and seven early stories,Gore Vidal,1995,Random House,Short Stories ,"In 1948, Gore Vidal was a celebrated twenty-two-year-old war novelist about to embark on a career in politics. His future seemed clear. But then he made a choice that changed his life. He published The City and the Pillar, an openly homosexual novel that was taken to be largely autobiographical. ""I have read that I was too stupid at the time to know what I was doing,"" he notes in his introduction to this edition, ""but in such matters I have always had a certain alertness.
I knew that my description of the love affair between two 'normal' all-American boys, of the sort that I had spent three years in the army with during the war, would challenge every superstition about sex in my native land."" His publisher hated the book. The New York Times would not advertise it. The City and the Pillar became a bestseller, nevertheless, and is now a classic. Thomas Mann called it a ""noble work."" The tragic story of Jim Willard's self-deluded love for another small-town American boy and the portrait of homosexual life in New York and Hollywood in the forties are still moving and truthful, as evocative and topical today as they were nearly fifty years ago.
This edition incorporates Vidal's 1965 revisions and some further emendations by the author. Vidal's only collection of short stories, published as A Thirsty Evil in 1956, is also included here, bringing together for the first time his early homoerotic work. These subtle and comic tales, set in Key West, Washington, D.C., Paris, and New York, are at once sophisticated and charming, written with the narrative power for which Gore Vidal is famous.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15121926-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15121926-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15121926-L.jpg,nan

157181423X,Anthropology & Law,James M. Donovan,July 2003,Berghahn Books,Anthropology ,"""The relationship between law and anthropology can be considered as having been particularly intimate. In this book the authors defend their assertion that the two fields co-exist in a condition of 'balanced reciprocity' wherein each makes important contributions to the successful practice and theory of the other. Anthropology, for example, offers a cross-culturally validated generic concept of 'law, ' and clarifies other important legal concepts such as 'religion' and 'human rights.' Law similarly illuminates key anthropological ideas such as the 'social contract, ' and provides a uniquely valuable access point for the analysis of sociocultural systems.
Legal practice renders a further important benefit to anthropology when it validates anthropological knowledge through the use of anthropologists as expert witnesses in the courtroom and the introduction of the 'culture defense' against criminal charges.""--Jacket.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/820954-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/820954-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/820954-L.jpg,nan

Dividing the vast historical expanse from the stone age to the 12th century into broad chronological units, it constructs profiles of various geographical regions of the subcontinent, weaving together and analysing an unparalleled range of literary and archaeological evidence. Dealing with prehistory and protohistory of the subcontinent in considerable detail, the narrative of the historical period breaks away from conventional text-based history writing. Providing a window into the world of primary sources, it incorporates a large volume of archaeological data, along with literary, epigraphic, and numismatic evidence. Revealing the ways in which our past is constructed, it explains fundamental concepts, and illuminates contemporary debates, discoveries, and research. Situating prevailing historical debates in their contexts, Ancient and Early Medieval India presents balanced assessments, encouraging readers to independently evaluate theories, evidence, and arguments. Beautifully illustrated with over four hundred photographs, maps, and figures, Ancient and Early Medieval India helps visualize and understand the extraordinarily rich and varied remains of the ancient past of Indian subcontinent. It offers a scholarly and nuanced—yet lucid—account of India’s early past, and will surely transform the discovery of this past into an exciting experience.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3367446-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3367446-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3367446-L.jpg,nan

   From girlhood, Lady Caroline Foster knew what her future held: marriage to an esteemed viscount, followed by a dignified high-society life. A sedate existence perhaps, but certainly preferable to her current state--jilted, humiliated, and then hastily bartered off to a man old enough to be her grandfather. Dreading the marriage, Caroline seeks advice from her ex-fiancé's illegitimate brother, whose potent sexuality has always intrigued her…
Ian Clayton can scarcely believe that the woman he's coveted from afar is boldly seeking sexual instruction. A true gentleman would turn her away, but the yearning he feels for Caroline surpasses anything he's ever known. Soon their encounters become more heated, more daring…and more dangerous. For someone will stop at nothing to end their illicit affair--and destroy a fantasy that is coming blissfully, brazenly to life…

155970697X,Nehru,Shashi Tharoor,2003,Arcade Pub.,India ,"""Born into a wealthy, politically influential Indian family in the waning years of the Raj, Jawaharlal Nehru was raised, under his father's careful guidance, on Western secularism and the humanist ideas of the Enlightenment. But it was not until he met Gandhi in 1916 that Nehru was transformed from an uninspired student into a fiery and motivated activist. The theories of democracy, human dignity, and self-determination from his student days became ideals to fight and live for. In Nehru and Gandhi, India found an invincible team - a spiritual father who could move millions and a political tactician who could galvanize them into action. Together, they led the nonviolent struggle for India's independence, a struggle that wasn't won until 1947. But neither Nehru nor Gandhi could prevent the horrific price for independence: partition."" ""In this fascinating account of an extraordinary life and career, Shashi Tharoor, eminent United Nations diplomat and author of India: From Midnight to the Millennium, traces Nehru's development from privileged child, posturing young nationalist, and valiant fighter for independence, to unchallengeable prime minister and global statesman. Tharoor casts an unflinching eye on Nehru's heroic efforts for, and stewardship of, independent, India and gives us a careful appraisal of his legacy to the world.""--Jacket.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7888519-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7888519-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7888519-L.jpg,nan

A child is presented with a marshmallow and given a choice: Eat this one now, or wait and enjoy two later. What will she do? And what are the implications for her behavior later in life? The world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? In The Marshmallow Test, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life--from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, The Marshmallow Test will change the way you think about who we are and what we can be.

But in Stephen King's world any place can serve as devil's ground...if the time of night is propitious, and the forces of darkness are strong, and the victims are caught just slightly off their guard...

9783426561195,Horror Date,Sebastian Fitzek,30 April 2025,Droemer HC,Horror ,"Denk an das schlimmste Date deines Lebens - und du bist noch nicht einmal nahe dran!
Bestseller-Autor Sebastian Fitzek hat seinen dritten Roman geschrieben:
»Horror-Date«. Kein Thriller - obwohl man beim Dating auf viele Psychos trifft!
Ein ebenso humorvoller wie lebenskluger Roman, eine grandiose Mischung aus Humor und existentiellen Fragen.
“The Walking Date” ist keine normale Dating-Plattform: Hier können sich Menschen, die nicht mehr lange zu leben haben, ein letztes Mal verlieben.
   Deshalb hat sich auch der unheilbar kranke Raphael bei TWD angemeldet, und tatsächlich funkt es zwischen ihm und der ebenfalls erkrankten Nala. Vor allem ihre Liebe zur Literatur verbindet die beiden, die sich bislang nur über Nicknames kennen.
   Am Tag ihres ersten Blind Dates hat sich Raphaels Zustand dramatisch verschlechtert. So überredet er seinen besten Freund, für ihn zu dem Treffen zu gehen: Julius, sportbegeistert, kerngesund und auch sonst das komplette Gegenteil von Raphael (er hat bislang nur die Biographie von Arnold Schwarzenegger gelesen, und auch die nur zur Hälfte!). Raphael zuliebe spielt Julius, der in wenigen Tagen heiraten und eigentlich seinen Junggesellenabschied feiern wollte, widerwillig den Schwerkranken – und das schlimmste Horror-Date aller Zeiten nimmt seinen Lauf …
Der dritte »Keinthriller« von Sebastian Fitzek nach »Der erste letzte Tag« und dem Jahresbestseller »Elternabend«
Der Bestseller-Autor begeistert nicht nur mit seinen düsteren Thrillern Millionen Leser*innen: Auch Sebastian Fitzeks humorvolle Romane mit Tiefgang standen wochenlang auf Platz 1 der SPIEGEL-Bestsellerliste. Die Fans sind sich einig: Sebastian Fitzek kann einfach gnadenlos gut erzählen!",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15114677-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15114677-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/15114677-L.jpg,nan

Alone in a strange city, Rosie begins to build a new life: she meets Bill Steiner and she finds an odd junk shop painting, 'Rose Madder', which strangely seem to want her as much as she wants it.
But it's hard for Rosie not to keep looking over her shoulder. Rose-maddened and on the rampage, Norman is a corrupt cop with a dog's instinct for tracking people. And he's getting close. Rosie can feel just how close he's getting...

It's the story of two father-and-son tyrant rulers who called themselves kings, both named Dionysius (pronounced Die-oh-nee-see-us). But the main character is Dion (pronounced Dion as in Lion), who was a relative, mentor, and finally mortal enemy to the second Dionysius. It has been pointed out that Dion and his siblings Megacles and Aristomache, as the children of Hipparinus, a wealthy and powerful man, had a social status that the upstart Dionysius I lacked, which suggests that envy might have been partially to blame for the increasing conflict between the families. However, Dionysius was clever enough to make use of Dion's good connections in his dealings with other rulers, where he himself, perhaps, might not have been shown as much respect.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8428805-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8428805-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8428805-L.jpg,nan

1501195972,Hearts in Atlantis,Stephen King,2017-11,Scribner,English ,"Innocence, experience, truth, deceit, loss, and recovery are at the core of these five interconnected, sequential tales—each deeply rooted in the 1960s, and each scarred by the Vietnam War, which continues to cast its shadow over American lives, politics and culture.
In Part One, “Low Men in Yellow Coats,” eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.
In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest, and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.
In “Blind Willie” and “Why We’re in Vietnam,” two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow—and as haunted—as their own lives.
And in “Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,” this remarkable book’s denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart’s desire may await him.
Full of danger and suspense, full of heart, this spellbinding fiction will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely forget. Nearly twenty years after its first publication, Hearts in Atlantis is powerful and astonishingly current. --back cover",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14653977-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14653977-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14653977-L.jpg,nan
0691097445,Eugene Onegin,Александр Сергеевич Пушкин,1975,Princeton University Press,English ,"Eugene Onegin (Russian: Евге́ний Оне́гин, BGN/PCGN: Yevgeniy Onegin) is a novel in verse written by Alexander Pushkin.
It is a classic of Russian literature, and its eponymous protagonist has served as the model for a number of Russian literary heroes (so-called superfluous men). It was published in serial form between 1825 and 1832. The first complete edition was published in 1833, and the currently accepted version is based on the 1837 publication.
Almost the entire work is made up of 389 stanzas of iambic tetrameter with the unusual rhyme scheme ""AbAbCCddEffEgg"", where the uppercase letters represent feminine rhymes while the lowercase letters represent masculine rhymes. This form has come to be known as the ""Onegin stanza"" or the ""Pushkin sonnet.""
The rhythm, innovative rhyme scheme, the natural tone and diction, and the economical transparency of presentation all demonstrate the virtuosity which has been instrumental in proclaiming Pushkin as the undisputed master of Russian poetry.
The story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin's public image), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate. The narrator digresses at times, usually to expand on aspects of this social and intellectual world. This allows for a development of the characters and emphasises the drama of the plot despite its relative simplicity.
The book is admired for the artfulness of its verse narrative as well as for its exploration of life, death, love, ennui, convention and passion. It influenced Vikram Seth's Golden Gate.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9944208-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9944208-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9944208-L.jpg,nan

Its narrator, Fabian Vas is a bird artist: He draws and paints the birds of Witless Bay, his remote Newfoundland coastal village home.

Later, he confesses who and what drove him to his crime--a measured, profoundly engrossing story of passion, betrayal, guilt, and redemption between men and women.

Announcing the completely revised and updated third edition of America's best-selling pregnancy book, What to Expect When You're Expecting. Two years in the making, it's a cover-to-cover, chapter-by-chapter, line-by-line revision and update. Everything that the original did-which, at just shy of 10 million copies in print, it did extraordinarily well-the third edition does, and better. Incorporating the most recent developments in medicine, and responding to the many queries and letters received from readers, the book contains both the most accurate information available, and the most reader-friendly. The third edition includes more information on working while pregnant. It offers more in-depth coverage of complementary and alternative birthing. Greater attention is paid to pre-conception, alternative families, second pregnancies, HMOs, the role of the father, and lifestyle. There's a completely new look at the best-odds diet, which is better suited to the needs of busier women with less time. An updated cover and all-new black-and-white illustrations give the classic a fresher look.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7133437-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7133437-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7133437-L.jpg,nan

THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.
   One Thursday lunchtime the Earth gets unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. For Arthur Dent, who has only just had his house demolished that morning, this seems already to be more than he can cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun, and the Galaxy is a very very very large and startling place.
THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.
   When all questions of space, time, matter and the nature of being have been resolved, only one question remains --- ""Where shall we have dinner?"" The Restaurant at the End of the Universe provides the ultimate gastronomic experience, and for once there is no morning after to worry about.
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING.
   In consequence of a number of stunning catastrophes, Arthur Dent is surprised to find himself living in a hideously miserable cave on prehistoric Earth. However, just as he thinks that things cannot possibly get any worse, they suddenly do. He discovers that the Galaxy is not only mind-boggling big and bewildering but also that most of the things that happen in it are staggeringly unfair.
SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH.
   Just as Arthur Dent's sense of reality is in its dickiest state he suddenly finds the girl of his dreams. He finds her in the last place in the Universe in which he would expect to find anything at all, but which 3,976,000 people will find oddly familiar. They go in search of God's Final Message to His Creation and, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it.

Harv Eker,2005,大塊文化,Literature ,"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money -- and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7310575-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7310575-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7310575-L.jpg,nan

Besides, it has a major role in the game industry, where knowledge of Lua has become an indisputable asset. Lua is the language of choice for anyone who needs a scripting language that is simple, efficient, extensible, portable, and free. Programming in Lua is the official book about the language, providing a solid base to any programmer who wants to use Lua. Authored by Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the language, it covers all aspects of Lua 5---from the basics to its API with C. The book is the main source of programming patterns for Lua, with numerous code examples that help the reader to make the most of Lua's flexibility and powerful mechanisms. Programming in Lua is targeted at people with some programming background, but does not assume any prior knowledge about Lua or other scripting languages. This Fourth Edition updates the book to Lua 5.3 and marks a complete reorganization of the text. Building on his many years of experience teaching Lua, Roberto has restructured the book to present the material in a growing order of complexity, allowing the reader to better absorb the character of the language.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9372924-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9372924-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9372924-L.jpg,nan

0007173113,The Lorax,Dr. Seuss,2004,Collins,Picture Books ,"Long before ""going green"" was mainstream, Dr. Seuss's Lorax spoke for the trees and warned of the dangers of disrespecting the environment. In this cautionary rhyming tale (printed on recycled paper) we learn of the Once-ler, who came across a valley of Truffula Trees and Brown Bar-ba-loots, and how his harvesting of the tufted trees changed the landscape forever. - Publisher. The Lorax is the story of a boy who's looking for answers. Living in a ruined town, this little guy wants to know the story of the Lorax, so he goes to the Once-ler, an elderly inventor/manufacturer. Doc Brown -- ahem, the Once-ler -- tells the boy how the town came to be ruined, and most importantly, what he can do to turn things around. Who exactly was this this Lorax character, what was it doing here, and why was it taken away? These are questions only a man name the Once-ler can answer. The Once-ler's last words to the boy: ""Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack./ Then the Lorax/ and all of his friends/ may come back."" - shmoop.com",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14422389-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14422389-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14422389-L.jpg,nan

On another level, the narrative is a powerful commentary on the workings of community values and on Canada's place within the British Empire.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1866084-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1866084-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1866084-L.jpg,nan

0316779490,Naked,David Sedaris,1997,"Little, Brown and Co.",Social Life and Customs ,"In Naked, David Sedaris's message - alternately rendered in ""Fakespeare,"" Italian, Spanish, and pidgin Greek - is the same: pay attention to me.
Whether he's taking to the road with a thieving quadriplegic, sorting out the fancy from the extra-fancy in a bleak fruit-packing factory, or celebrating Christmas in the company of a recently paroled prostitute, this collection of memoirs creates a wickedly incisive portrait of an all-too-familiar world. It takes Sedaris from his humiliating bout with obsessive behavior in ""A Plague of Tics"" to the title story, in which he is finally forced to face his naked self in the mirrored sunglasses of a lunatic.
At this soulful and moving moment, he picks potato chip crumbs from his pubic hair and wonders what it all means. This remarkable journey into his own life follows a path of self-effacement and a lifelong search for identity, leaving him both under suspicion and overdressed.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6630199-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6630199-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6630199-L.jpg,nan

Set in Russia before the emancipation of serfs in 1861, the ""dead souls"" are dead serfs still being counted by landowners as property, as well as referring to the landowners' morality. Through surreal and often dark comedy, Gogol criticizes Russian society after the Napoleonic Wars. He intended to also offer solutions to the problems he satirized, but died before he ever completed the second part of what was intended to be a trilogy.

1573921769,The  descent of man,Charles Darwin,1998,Prometheus Books,Social Life and Customs ,"The Descent of Man, Darwin's second landmark work on evolutionary theory (following The Origin of the Species), marked a turning point in the history of science with its modern vision of human nature as the product of evolution. Darwin argued that the noblest features of humans, such as language and morality, were the result of the same natural processes that produced iris petals and scorpion tails.To convey the revolutionary importance of this groundbreaking book, renowned evolutionary science writer Carl Zimmer edited this special abridged edition—made up of nine excerpts, each one representing one of Darwin's major themes—and wrote illuminating introductions to each section, as well as an overall introduction. Zimmer brilliantly places Darwin's basic ideas in the context of the current understanding of human nature and twenty-first-century DNA research. By accessibly presenting Darwin's thinking to a modern readership, Zimmer eloquently demonstrates Darwin's ever-increasing relevance and amazing scientific insight.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/825762-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/825762-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/825762-L.jpg,nan

They are visited by two guests this particular day who turn their world upside down. The family in this play consist of a dominating Mommy, an emasculated Daddy and a clever and witty Grandma. A neighbor, Mrs. Barker, enters and the dialogue continues with the occasional interjection by Grandma. Mommy and Daddy exit leaving Mrs. Barker and Grandma alone. Grandma apparently knows why Mrs. Barker has been asked to come by and explains to her that Mommy and Daddy had adopted a son from her many years previously. As the parents objected to the child's actions, they mutilated it as punishment, eventually killing it. After Mrs. Barker exits, a Young Man appears at the door looking for work.

Under the general editorship of Herbert Golder and the late William Arrowsmith, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays.
This vital translation of Euripides' Electra recreates the prize-winning excitement of the original play. Electra, obsessed by dreams of avenging her father's murder, impatiently awaits the return of her exiled brother Orestes. After his arrival Electra uses Orestes as her instrument of vengeance, killing their mother's husband, then their mother herself - and only afterward do they see the evil inherent in these seemingly just acts.
But in his usual fashion, Euripides has imbued myth with the reality of human experience, counterposing suspense and horror with comic realism and down-to-earth comments on life.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10244458-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10244458-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10244458-L.jpg,nan

Now the author of eight consecutive New York Times bestsellers delivers her most powerful book yet--the story of a man and woman forced to choose between the past that haunts them and the love that won't let them go.Jane Porter left the apple orchards of rural Twin Rivers, Rhode Island, years ago, fleeing memories that could tear two families apart.  Now she has been unexpectedly drawn home to her mother and only sister.  Dylan Chadwick has come back, too, shedding the steely exterior he wore as a federal agent in order to follow in the footsteps of his apple-farming father and forget the life he once lived.  Amid this landscape of loss and renewal, a haunting story of converging lives, small-town secrets--and the magical sway of unexpected miracles--unfolds.  Deeply moving and richly told, Dance with Me explores emotional connections at their very core, with keen insights into the lives of mothers and daughters, sisters and lovers that will resonate long after the final page is turned.From the Hardcover edition.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4245665-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4245665-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4245665-L.jpg,nan

Trying to mix business with pleasure, KEY News correspondent Diane Mayfield has brought her children and her sister to the New Jersey shore town of Ocean Grove to investigate a story on ""girls who cry wolf"" for the season premiere of Hourglass, television's highly rated news magazine. Diane lands an exclusive interview with a troubled young woman whose tale of being abducted and held against her will for three terrifying days had been disbelieved by the authorities. No sooner does Diane finish taping the interview, though, than a second victim disappears. The small community, already in the grip of a record heat wave, is now wracked by fear and terror, no one knows who could be next.

Lansdowne,2002,Zebra Books, Dance ,"From the back cover. — Perhaps His Birthright Was Questionable... — Josiah Elliot had undertaken some remarkable pursuits in his time, but his courtship of Lady Miranda Wesley was by far the most scandalous. What business had a poverty-stricken reformed highwayman, now working as a valet, with a noblewoman? None, to be quite precise. But love was the most illogical of emotions--and Josiah could claim a pedigree linking him to an ancient dukedom. If only he could find the blasted evidence...
But His Appeal Was Undeniable
Formidably independent--and not a little bit impatient--Miranda had had enough of waiting. What if the man you loved had disappeared into London without so much as a by-your-leave, she longed to ask anyone who cared to listen. The fact that Josiah was considered a ne'er-do-well was beside the point entirely. Whatever questions society had about his past, she cared not a whit for the answers.

049802234X,The dark side of the screen,Foster Hirsch,1981,A. S. Barnes, Film ,"""Since The Dark Side of the Screen first appeared two decades ago, when film noir was still a little-known group of dark, brooding postwar B movies, it has become the essential take on what has become one of today's most pervasive screen influences and popular genres. Covering over a hundred outstanding films and offering nearly two hundred carefully chosen stills, this is by far the most thorough and entertaining study available of noir themes, visual motifs, character types, actors, and directors.
Hirsch examines the features that make Burt Lancaster, Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart into noir icons: as well as the camera angles, lighting effects, and story lines that characterize the work of such major noir directors as Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Orson Welles. With a complete list of credits to 112 films and a new introduction, Hirsch's work remains the classic analysis of the most original genre of American cinema.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4364729-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4364729-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4364729-L.jpg,nan

Ghatak,2004,Kluwer Academic Pulbishers,Physics ,"An understanding of quantum mechanics is vital to all students of physics, chemistry and electrical engineering, but requires a lot of mathematical concepts, the details of which are given with great clarity in this book. Various concepts have been derived from first principles, so it can also be used for self-study. The chapters on the JWKB approximation, time-independent perturbation theory and effects of magnetic field stand out for their clarity and easy-to-understand mathematics. Two complete chapters on the linear harmonic oscillator provide a very detailed discussion of one of the most fundamental problems in quantum mechanics. Operator algebra is used to show the ease with which one can calculate the harmonic oscillator wave functions and study the evolution of the coherent state. Similarly, three chapters on angular momentum give a detailed account of this important problem. Perhaps the most attractive feature of the book is the excellent balance between theory and applications and the large number of applications in such diverse areas as astrophysics, nuclear physics, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, solid-state physics, and quantum well structures.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9139625-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9139625-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9139625-L.jpg,nan

Aashvi, Kate, Bette, Keiko, Gaia, and Day are six queer, mostly trans women surviving and thriving in Brooklyn. Visiting all the fixtures of fashionable 21st century queer society--picnics, literary readings, health conferences, drag shows, punk houses, community accountability processes, Grindr hookups--The Call-Out also engages with pressing questions around economic precarity, sexual consent, racism in queer spaces, and feminist theory, in the service of asking what it takes to build, or destroy, a marginalized community.
A novel written in verse, The Call-Out recalls the Russian literary classic Eugene Onegin, but instead of 19th century Russian aristocrats crudely solved their disagreements with pistols, the participants in this rhyming drama have developed a more refined weapon, the online call-out, a cancel-culture staple. In this passionate tangle of modern relationships, where a barbed tweet can be as dangerous as the narrator's bon-mots, Cat Fitzpatrick has fashioned a modern novel of manners that gives readers access to a vibrant cultural underground.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14406715-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14406715-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14406715-L.jpg,nan

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/134964-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/134964-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/134964-L.jpg,nan

9781951142292,My Autobiography of Carson McCullers,Jenn Shapland,2021,"Tin House Books, LLC",Autobiographies ,"How do you tell the real story of someone misremembered—an icon and idol—alongside your own? Jenn Shapland’s celebrated debut is both question and answer: an immersive, surprising exploration of one of America’s most beloved writers, alongside a genre-defying examination of identity, queerness, memory, obsession, and love.
Shapland is a graduate student when she first uncovers letters written to Carson McCullers by a woman named Annemarie. Though Shapland recognizes herself in the letters, which are intimate and unabashed in their feelings, she does not see McCullers as history has portrayed her. Her curiosity gives way to fixation, not just with this newly discovered side of McCullers’s life, but with how we tell queer love stories. Why, Shapland asks, are the stories of women paved over by others’ narratives? What happens when constant revision is required of queer women trying to navigate and self-actualize in straight spaces? And what might the tracing of McCullers’s life—her history, her secrets, her legacy—reveal to Shapland about herself?
In smart, illuminating prose, Shapland interweaves her own story with McCullers’s to create a vital new portrait of one of our nation’s greatest literary treasures, and shows us how the writers we love and the stories we tell about ourselves make us who we are.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11197881-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11197881-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11197881-L.jpg,nan

0824003187,Lay down your arms,Bertha von Suttner,1972,Garland Pub.,Autobiographies ,"In The Autobiography of Martha von Tilling, the pacifist Bertha von Suttner writes the fictionalized autobiography of the eponymous Austrian noblewoman. Beginning with the Austro-Sardinian war of 1859, continuing through the Second Schleswig War and the Austro-Prussian war, and concluding with the Franco-Prussian war, von Tilling paints a graphic and often intense portrayal of war and the effects it has not just on the protagonist, but on family and society.Drawing on her own wartime experiences as a civilian as well as interviews with war veterans, von Suttner produces a memorable critique of the war-mentality, along with a passionate plea for peace between the European nations. Little is spared from criticism: from scrupulous kings and political leaders praying on ill-conceived notions of nationalism, to religious leaders tying themselves in knots to provide biblical justifications for war, to an educational system that sets out soldiering as the highest ideal of manhood and supporting soldiers as the highest ideal of womanhood.Von Suttner was a prolific anti-war activist, and would later become the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Originally published in German in 1889, Lay Down Your Arms is her most well-known statement on the disastrous effects of war. It has been translated into at least sixteen languages and was praised shortly after its release by Leo Tolstoy, among others.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14635358-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14635358-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14635358-L.jpg,nan

1473605172,Playing it my way,Sachin Tendulkar,2015,Hodder & Stoughton,Plays ,"The greatest run-scorer in the history of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 after an astonishing 24 years at the top. The most celebrated Indian cricketer of all time, he received the Bharat Ratna Award - India's highest civilian honour - on the day of his retirement. Now Sachin Tendulkar tells his own remarkable story - from his first Test cap at the age of 16 to his 100th international century and the emotional final farewell that brought his country to a standstill. When a boisterous Mumbai youngster's excess energies were channelled into cricket, the result was record-breaking schoolboy batting exploits that launched the career of a cricketing phenomenon. Before long Sachin Tendulkar was the cornerstone of India's batting line-up, his every move watched by a cricket-mad nation's devoted followers. Never has a cricketer been burdened with so many expectations; never has a cricketer performed at such a high level for so long and with such style - scoring more runs and making more centuries than any other player, in both Tests and one-day games. And perhaps only one cricketer could have brought together a shocked nation by defiantly scoring a Test century shortly after terrorist attacks rocked Mumbai. His many achievements with India include winning the World Cup and topping the world Test rankings. Yet he has also known his fair share of frustration and failure - from injuries and early World Cup exits to stinging criticism from the press, especially during his unhappy tenure as captain. Despite his celebrity status, Sachin Tendulkar has always remained a very private man, devoted to his family and his country. Now, for the first time, he provides a fascinating insight into his personal life and gives a frank and revealing account of a sporting life like no other.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10400033-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10400033-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10400033-L.jpg,nan

The horrific brutality which both women and children undergo evokes a response of unparalleled intensity in the playwright whom Aristotle called the most tragic of poets. Yet the new battle-ground of the aftermath of war is one in which the women of Troy evince an overwhelming greatness of spirit. We weep for the aged Hecuba in her name play and in the Trojan Women, yet we respond with an at times appalled admiration to her resilience amid unrelieved suffering. And in her name play Andromache, the slave-concubine of her husband's killer, endures her existence in the victor's country with a stoic nobility. Of their time yet timeless, these plays insist on the victory of the female spirit amid the horrors visited on them by gods and men during war.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1131356-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1131356-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1131356-L.jpg,nan

Este lúcido análisis se cierra con una sección dedicada al día después del combate, cuando el humo se disipa del campo de batalla, y a la forma de evitar o, en su caso, gestionar, el trastorno por estrés postraumático.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12728672-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12728672-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12728672-L.jpg,nan

Worse yet, this happens in front of his new crush, Leo, the dreamy football star who just moved to town. Fantastic. When he discovers his eccentric employer Pavel Chudinov is an intermediary between the human world and its myths, Bridger is plunged into a world of pixies, werewolves, and Sasquatch. The realm of myths and magic is growing increasingly unstable, and it is up to Bridger to ascertain the cause of the chaos, eliminate the problem, and help his boss keep the real world from finding the world of myths""--Back cover.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12361558-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12361558-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12361558-L.jpg,nan

0839824033,Swords and Ice Magic,Fritz Leiber,1977,Gregg Press,Magic ,"""Wonderful, magical Fritz Leiber, before whom Bradbury and Sturgeon and Norton and Goldman and Barth and Vonnegut bow, not to mention Robinson, Busby, Anderson and even yours truly, the maddest egomaniac of them all. Fritz Leiber, very likely the best of all of us, the man who has won more awards than anyone else in the genre, the man whose words have lifted this too often wretched category to Olympian heights more than anyone cares to mention."" -Harlan Ellison Before Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Fritz Leiber’s fantastic but thoroughly flawed anti-heroes, Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, adventured and stumbled deep within the caves of Inner Earth as well. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon’s grandest and most mystically corrupt city. Lankhmar is Leiber’s fully realized vivid incarnation of urban decay and civilization’s corroding effect on the human psyche. Fafhrd and Mouse are not innocents; their world is no land of honor and righteousness. It is a world of human complexities and violent action, of discovery and mystery, of swords and sorcery. In Swords and Ice Magic, Fafhrd and Gray Mouser discover how the sadness of The Executioner creates a macabre dance from the point of view of the choreographer. Beauties and beasts explain the dual nature of all life’s creatures. And trapped in The Shadowland, our dogmatic duo find the duality of swords and needles, maps and territories, girls and demons…and gods, they learn of the mischievous vanity of the gods. Lost at sea, Gray Mouser becomes a natural philosopher, drifting, captive of the Great Equatorial Current. He wonders about fire and ice, about women and men until they arrive at Rime Isle, a tragic comedy of a place, wandering gods and restless mortals, a comedy with puppets and puppet-masters.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13176820-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13176820-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13176820-L.jpg,nan

With the cultural rediscovery of Mitteleuropa, Roth's territory - geographical and spiritual - is sharply back in focus.
The Radetzky March, first published in 1932, is Joseph Roth's greatest literary achievement, a novel of world literary rank. Spanning three generations of the Trotta family and set in the waning days of the Hapsburg Empire, the novel unfolds with marvelous subtlety to reveal its splendidly modern ironies.
One event sets the novel in motion: as Captain Joseph Trotta, a Slovenian infantryman, saves the Emperor Franz Joseph from a bullet, Trotta's act, with the inexorable power of destiny, determines the lives of the succeeding sons of the Trotta family until, generations later, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the elder Trotta's heroic act lose their mythical power over those held in their thrall.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418869-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418869-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418869-L.jpg,nan

It is the problem of merging quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two great conceptual revolutions in the physics of the twentieth century. The loop and spinfoam approach, presented in this book, is one of the leading research programs in the field. The first part of the book discusses the reformulation of the basis of classical and quantum Hamiltonian physics required by general relativity. The second part covers the basic technical research directions. Appendices include a detailed history of the subject of quantum gravity, hard-to-find mathematical material, and a discussion of some philosophical issues raised by the subject. This fascinating text is ideal for graduate students entering the field, as well as researchers already working in quantum gravity. It will also appeal to philosophers and other scholars interested in the nature of space and time.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8712440-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8712440-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8712440-L.jpg,nan

0385680910,"Smarter, faster, better",Charles Duhigg,2016,Doubleday Canada,Business Success ,"""From the bestselling author of The Power of Habit comes a fascinating new book exploring the science of productivity, and why, in today's world, managing how you think--rather than what you think about--can transform your life. Productivity, recent studies suggest, isn't always about driving ourselves harder, working faster and pushing ourselves toward greater ""efficiency."" Rather, real productivity relies on managing how we think, identify goals, construct teams and make decisions. The most productive people, companies and organizations don't merely act differently--they envision the world and their choices in profoundly different ways. This book explores eight concepts that are critical to increasing productivity. It takes you into the cockpit of two passenger jets (one crashes) to understand the importance of constructing mental models--telling yourself stories about yourself in order to subconsciously focus on what really matters. It introduces us to basic training in the U.S. Marine Corps, where the internal locus of control is exploited to increase self-motivation. It chronicles the outbreak of Israel's Yom Kippur War to examine cognitive closure--a dangerous trap that stems from our natural desire to feel productive and check every last thing off our to-do lists, causing us to miss obvious risks and bigger opportunities. It uses a high-achieving public school in Cincinnati to illuminate the concept of disfluency, which holds that we learn faster and more deeply when we make the data harder to absorb. It shows how the principles of lean manufacturing--in which decision-making power is pushed to the lowest levels of the hierarchy--allowed the FBI to produce a software system that had eluded them for years. It explores how Disney made Frozen into a record success by encouraging tension among animation teams--a version of what biologists refer to as the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, which posits that nature is most creative when crises occur. With the combination of relentless curiosity, deep reporting and rich storytelling that defined The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg takes readers from neurology laboratories to Google's brainstorming sessions and illustrates how we can all increase productivity in our lives.""--Publisher's website.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12716977-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12716977-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12716977-L.jpg,nan

8170004985,The Five Laws of Library Science,S. R. Ranganathan,"August 18, 2006",Ess Ess Publications,Science,"Ranganathan coined five ""laws"", as principles that still guide the operation of modern libraries:1. Books are for use.2. Books are for all.3. Every book its reader.4. Save the time of the reader.5. The library is a growing organism. Each of these is discussed in depth, with numerous examples drawn from library systems around the world, to establish the principles underlying the then-fledgling Indian library movement. S. R. (Shiyali Ramamrita) Ranganathan, considered by librarians all over the world to be the father of modern library science, proposed five laws of library science in the early 1930s. Most librarians worldwide accept them as the foundations of the philosophy of their work and service in the library. These laws are: Books are for use, Every reader his or her book, Every book its reader, Save the time of the reader, and The library is a growing organism. The Five Laws of Library Science are some of the most influential concepts in the field. Since they were published in 1931, these five laws ""have remained a centerpiece of professional values..."" (Rubin 2004). These basic theories of Library Science continue to directly impact the development of this discipline and the service of all libraries. [From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]. The book has been reprinted over twenty-five times to meet the demand from libraries, students of library and information science and information professionals. In 2006 when DLIST (University of Arizona) placed a test version of the contents page and first chapter of the first edition of the book on the Internet, there were some 640 downloads in twenty-four hours. The ""five laws"" are equally valid in the present digital / information age as they have been in the conventional library environment.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7259757-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7259757-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7259757-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL356224W/The_Five_Laws_of_Library_Science

Storch,1982,Croom Helm Ltd,Social Life and Customs,"Book jacket blurb: This book is concerned with the tensions between continuity and change in the customs, rituals, values and beliefs of artisans, factory workers and sections of the lower middle class in the nineteenth century. Material is drawn from all parts of the British Isles, including Cornwall, where traditional beliefs showed intriguing similarities with Methodism. Arguments adduced to account for changes in custom include the effects of urbanisation, conflict over the use of public land, new conceptions of public order, the decline ofthe oral tradition and the growth of a new recreational nexus in the larger cities. The book demonstrates the enormous variety and diversity of popular tradition, which defies any facile categorisation.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9719513-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9719513-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9719513-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19310690W/Popular_culture_and_custom_in_nineteenth-century_England

Mencken,1996,The Johns Hopkins University Press,Social Life and Customs,"Mencken, with his acerbic wit and tongue planted permanently near if not in cheek, laments a world where some feel that all original criticism has been done. New ideas are old ideas with new vocabularies. The things we choose to let offend us today are really the same as those in the past wearing shoes with platform souls just to seem a bit more ominous.With this hopeless situation, it becomes the job of pseudo-scholar to abandon criticism or carnal evils and move on to criticizing the criticism itself. Surely we, being more enlightened, more intelligent and more alive (always a key to proving your superiority to those before your time) can provide a better analysis of what is wrong with everything and right with nothing.I just dashed this off quickly one evening in an effort to snag others to read and evaluate. Feel free to liberally edit or delete my description. Since we have been born of immaculate perception, free from the sin of bias, it is our duty to point out for our contemporaries and our posterity what is truly ""right"" and what is--well, maybe ""less right"", for in our relativistic culture there is not wrong; 2 + 2 may equal 5 or even 3 from a point of view superior to our own.Find yourself in these pages.

1410408027,The German bride,Joanna Hershon,2008,Thorndike Press,German,"Berlin, 1865. Eva Frank, the daughter of a benevolent Jewish banker, and her sister, Henriette, are having their portrait painted--which leads to a secret affair between young Eva and the mercurial artist. This indiscretion has far-reaching consequences, more devastating than Eva or her family could have imagined. Distraught and desperate to escape her painful situation, Eva hastily marries Abraham Shein, an ambitious merchant who has returned home to Germany for the first time in a decade since establishing himself in the American West. The eighteen-year-old bride leaves Berlin and its ghosts for an unfamiliar life halfway across the world, traversing the icy waters of the Atlantic and the rugged, sweeping terrain of the Santa Fe Trail.Though Eva's existence in the rough and burgeoning community of Sante Fe, New Mexico, is a far cry from her life as a daughter of privilege, she soon begins to settle into the mystifying town, determined to create a home. But this new setting cannot keep at bay the overwhelming memories of her former life, nor can it protect her from an increasing threat to her own safety that will force Eva to make a fateful decision.Joanna Hershon's novel is a gripping and gritty portrayal of urban European immigrants struggling with New World frontier life in the mid-nineteenth century. Vivid and emotionally compelling, The German Bride is also a beautiful narrative on how far one must travel to make peace with the past.From the Hardcover edition.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7968187-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7968187-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7968187-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL6032903W/The_German_Bride

Sebastian Conrad charts the expansion of the empire from its origins in the acquisition of substantial territories in present day Togo, Cameroon, Namibia and Tanzania to new settlements in East Asia and the Pacific and reveals the colonialist culture which permeated the German nation and its politics. Drawing on the wider history of European expansion and globalisation he highlights the close interactions and shared vocabularies of the colonial powers and emphasizes Germany's major role in the period of high imperialism before 1914. Even beyond the official end of the empire in 1919 the quest for Lebensraum and the growth of the Nazi empire in Eastern Europe can be viewed within a framework of colonialism whose effects resonate to the present day.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13172027-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13172027-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13172027-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16014438W/German_colonialism

9780199838820,The biology of homosexuality,J. Balthazart,2011,Oxford University Press,Biology,"""In this fascinating book, Jacques Balthazart presents a simple description of the biological mechanisms that are involved in the determination of sexual orientation in animals and also presumably in humans. Using scientific studies published over the last few decades, he argues that sexual orientation, both homosexual and heterosexual, is under the control of embryonic endocrine and genetic phenomena in which there is little room for individual choice. The author begins with animal studies of the hormonal and neural mechanisms that control the so-called instinctive behaviors and analyzes how this animal work may potentially apply to humans. The book does not focus exclusively on homosexuality, however. Instead, the book acts as a broader guide to the biological basis of sexual orientation, and also discusses important gender differences that may influence sexual orientation. While firmly grounded in the scientific literature, this text is developed for a broader audience and will be of interest to psychologists, researchers, students, and anyone interested in the biological factors that determine our sexuality""-- ""This book summarizes evidence indicating that, contrary to the commonly held belief, human sexual orientation is controlled by a set of hormonal, genetic and possibly immunological factors acting mostly prenatally""--",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11026896-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11026896-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11026896-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16142775W/The_biology_of_homosexuality

At its center: Toby O'Dare--a contract killer of underground fame on assignment to kill once again. A soulless soul, a dead man walking, he lives under a series of aliases--just now: Lucky the Fox--and takes his orders from ""The Right Man.""Into O'Dare's nightmarish world of lone and lethal missions comes a mysterious stranger, a seraph, who offers him a chance to save rather than destroy lives. O'Dare, who long ago dreamt of being a priest but instead came to embody danger and violence, seizes his chance. Now he is carried back through the ages to thirteenth-century England, to dark realms where accusations of ritual murder have been made against Jews, where children suddenly die or disappear . . . In this primitive setting, O'Dare begins his perilous quest for salvation, a journey of danger and flight, loyalty and betrayal, selflessness and love.From the Hardcover edition.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9324119-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9324119-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9324119-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14962785W/Angel_time
0440118387,Deus irae,Philip K. Dick,1977,Dell,French,"Deus Irae is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by American authors Philip K. Dick and Roger Zelazny. It was published in 1976. Deus irae, meaning God of Wrath in Latin, is a play on Dies Irae, meaning Day of Wrath or Judgment Day. This novel is based on Dick's short story ""The Great C."" Dick began the book but realized he did not know enough about Christianity to finish it. He asked Ted White to collaborate on it with him, but after reviewing the manuscript White never got started. Zelazny discovered the manuscript in White's home in early 1968, read it, then contacted Dick and agreed to work on it with him. Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or repayment of the advance paid to Dick. The editor discovered Zelazny had sent photocopies of some pages and demanded the originals as per Doubleday's policy; much to Zelazny's chagrin, he had to send in the urine-stained pages and he always wondered what the editor made of them.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9249939-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9249939-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9249939-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2172512W/Deus_Irae

0300224303,Ill Composed,Olivia Weisser,"Sep 27, 2016",Yale University Press,Composers,"""In the first in-depth study of how gender determined perceptions and experiences of illness in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England, Olivia Weisser invites readers into the lives and imaginations of ordinary men and women. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including personal diaries, medical texts, and devotional literature, the author enters the sickrooms of a diverse sampling of early modern Britons. The resulting stories of sickness reveal how men and women of the era viewed and managed their health both similarly and differently, as well as the ways prevailing religious practices, medical knowledge, writing conventions, and everyday life created and supported those varying perceptions. A unique cultural history of illness, Weisser's groundbreaking study bridges the fields of patient history and gender history. Based on the detailed examination of over fifty firsthand accounts, this fascinating volume offers unprecedented insight into what it was like to live, suffer, and inhabit a body more than three centuries ago.""--Publisher's description.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10030437-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10030437-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10030437-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20783707W/Ill_Composed

Comment est-il arrivé dans cette cage d'escalier où il a passé la nuit ? Un bruit suspect l'attire vers l'ascenseur : à l'intérieur, un homme gît, mortellement blessé. Avant de rendre un dernier souffle, il appelle le garçon auprès de lui pour lui murmurer des mots incompréhensibles. Suspect numéro un, Ram doit fuir. Mais la police n'est pas la seule à ses trousses. Quelqu'un en veut à sa vie. Toujours poursuivi par l'homme en noir, Ram erre dans la lande. Par chance il est recueilli par William et Mary, un jeune couple charmant. Mais lorsque ceux-ci lui affirment qu'il est leur neveu et l'emmènent de force à l'école du village, Ram commence à s'inquiéter. Peu à peu, d'étranges souvenirs d'explosions et de violence lui reviennent, et il acquiert la certitude qu'il a un rôle crucial à jouer... Au village la population est en état de choc : plusieurs corps ont été retrouvés dans la lande, déchiquetés par une bête sauvage. Mais ce n'est pas le seul danger que doit affronter Ram, car l'homme en noir retrouve bientôt sa trace... Après avoir échappé à l'Homme en Noir, Ram se blesse et trouve refuge chez Bella, une vieille excentrique, qui le prend sous son aile le temps de sa convalescence. Il découvre alors une vallée pleine de mystère : des gens disparaissent dans les Chutes du Désespoir, d'étranges lueurs vertes balaient le ciel au coeur de la nuit. Sans parler du Fauve, l'homme des bois qui rôde en ville et terrifie les enfants...Avant de repartir, Ram décide de faire la lumière sur toute cette histoire. Mais le Jour où l'Homme en Noir le retrouve, Il s'interroge : Bella l'a-t-elle trahi ? Et si l'Homme en Noir n'était pas son seul ennemi ? Depuis qu'il s'est réveillé dans cette cage d'escalier, Ram n'a cessé de fuir l'Homme en Noir. Traqué, il lit dans le journal un étrange article : un reporter recherche des témoins de l'attentat, persuadé qu'il s'agit d'un complot. Ram croit avoir enfin trouvé en Shanti une alliée de confiance. II sait aussi qu'il ne doit en aucun cas baisser sa garde. Peu à peu, de terribles souvenirs lui reviennent en mémoire et remettent tout en question. Déboussolé, Ram n'a qu'une certitude : s'il ne fait rien, une bombe explosera.

1617037680,Southern Frontier Humor,Edward J. Piacentino,"May 06, 2013",University Press of Mississippi,Humor,"""Since its inception in the early 1830s, southern frontier humor (also known as the humor of the Old Southwest) has had enduring appeal. The onset of the new millennium precipitated an impressive rejuvenation of scholarly interest. Beyond Southern Frontier Humor represents the next step in this revival, providing a series of essays with fresh perspectives and contexts. First, the book shows the importance of Henry Junius Nott, a virtually unknown and forgotten writer who mined many of the principal subjects, themes, tropes, and character types associated with southern frontier humor, followed by an essay addressing how this humor genre and its ideological impact helped to stimulate a national cultural revolution. Several essays focus on the genre's legacy to the post-Civil War era, exploring intersections between southern frontier humor and southern local color writers--Joel Chandler Harris, Charles W. Chesnutt, and Sherwood Bonner. Mark Twain's African American dialect piece ""A True Story,"" though employing some of the conventions of southern frontier humor, is reexamined as a transitional text, showing his shift to broader concerns, particularly in race portraiture. Essays also examine the evolution of the trickster from the Jack Tales to Hooper's Simon Suggs to similar mountebanks in novels of John Kennedy Toole, Mark Childress, and Clyde Edgerton and transnational contexts, the latter exploring parallels between southern frontier humor and the Jamaican Anansi tales. Finally, the genre is situated contextually, using contemporary critical discourses, which are applied to G. W. Harris's Sut Lovingood and to various frontier hunting stories.""--Publisher's website.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9026216-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9026216-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/9026216-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20359410W/Southern_Frontier_Humor

The book not only highlights the history and development of forensic anthropology in Europe but also illustrates the diversity of work, the different academic backgrounds of those practicing in the field, and the different approach that they have towards the work that they undertake, making this book unique.^ In addition to covering the work undertaken in a number of European countries, the case studies presented cover a range of issues dealt with by forensic anthropologists from around the world including; stab wounds; blunt force trauma; gunshot wounds; dismemberment; burning; personal identification, including issues relating to the investigation of ancestry in European investigations; juvenile human remains; the work of forensic anthropologists in unsolved cases; and work undertaken to eliminate discoveries of human remains from police investigations. The final chapter of the book explores new developments in the field of forensic anthropology with gait analysis and facial recognition of a living individual based on analysis of CCTV footage. This book is primarily designed for students of forensic anthropology and those engaged in forensic anthropological work in various areas of the world.^ Each chapter contains clear up- to-date references and a full discussion of the techniques applied, which also make this book accessible for the nonspecialist reader.""--Publisher's website.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1199156-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1199156-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1199156-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18675509W/Forensic_anthropology

Spain was then very much a marginal power, condemned by nearly four decades of dictatorship to Europe's political periphery. Since 1975 the country has undergone a dramatic political transformation. Often seen as a 'model' for the former communist regimes of Eastern Europe, Spain's post-Franco transition not only established a vibrant democracy but also managed to keep in check the deep divisions which had characterised the country for centuries. Yet, although Spain's transition to democracy has been the focus of extensive political and academic analysis, far less attention has been paid to subsequent developments. This book provides the first comprehensive assessment of the government and politics of democratic Spain, setting its distinctive features in both historical and comparative context. The book pays particular attention to the devolved and regional character of Spanish government, the role of the monarchy and the constitution and the evolution of the political parties since the downfall of the dictatorship.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3811280-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3811280-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3811280-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2936449W/The_government_and_politics_of_Spain

More than 150 people -- primarily women -- from 24 communities were charged with witchcraft; 19 were hanged and others died in prison. In his introduction to this compact yet comprehensive volume, Richard Godbeer explores the beliefs, fears, and historical context that fueled the witch panic of 1692. The documents in this collection illuminate how the Puritans' worldview led them to seek a supernatural explanation for the problems vexing their community. Presented as case studies, the carefully chosen records from several specific trials offer a clear picture of the gender norms and social tensions that underlie the witchcraft accusations. The final documents cover recantations of confessions, the aftermath of the witch hunt, and statements of regret.

In a concise and readable account, Lewis examines the awakening that accompanied the advent of Islam and the political, religious, and social developments that transformed the Arab kingdom into an Islamic empire. He brings the edition up-to-the-minute with an account of recent events in the Middle East and analyzes the forces, internal and external, that have shaped the modern Arab world. Lewis shows how Western inventions and institutions have shattered the old structures and the traditional way of life, affecting every Arab, and causing a still unsatisfied demand for social, political, and cultural renewal.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119804-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119804-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/119804-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1157054W/The_Arabs_in_history
0679450882,A short history of Byzantium,John Julius Norwich,1999,Knopf,History,"At a moment when the splendors of Byzantine art are being rediscovered and celebrated in America, John Julius Norwich has brought together in this remarkable edition the most important and fascinating events of his dazzling trilogy of the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire. With wit, intelligence and an unerring eye for riveting detail, Lord Norwich tells the dramatic history of Byzantium from its beginnings in AD 330 when Constantine the Great moved the imperial capital from Rome to the site of an old Greek port in Asia Minor called Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople, to its rise as the first and most long-lasting Christian empire, to its final heroic days and eventual defeat by the Turks in 1453. It was a history marked by tremendous change and drama: the adoption of Christianity by the Greco-Roman world; the fall of Rome and its empire; the defeat by the Seljuk Turks at Manzikert in 1071; the reigns of Constantine, Theodosius the Great, Justinian and Basil II. There were centuries of bloodshed in which the empire struggled for its life; centuries of controversy in which men argued about the nature of Christ and the Church; centuries of scholarship in which ancient culture was kept alive and preserved by scribes; and, most of all, centuries of creativity in which the Byzantine genius brought forth art and architecture inspired by a depth of spirituality unparalleled in any other age. After more than fourteen centuries, the ever-dazzling brilliance of the mosaics of Ravenna and the ethereal splendor of the great church of St. Sophia in Istanbul still have the power to take one's breath away.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418857-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418857-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/418857-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL764345W/A_short_history_of_Byzantium

1564147967,Chinese Astrology,Shelly Wu,June 2005,New Page Books,Chinese,"""He who knows others is learned. He who knows himself is wise.""-Lao-TzuThe quest for self-knowledge has been a universal human pursuit for millenniums. Who are we? And could our destiny be written in the stars? Why do some commit their wings to life's flames, while others tiptoe through life so cautiously? In a quest for answers to these questions, there has been an explosion of renewed interest in Chinese astrology. Awareness of our essential nature provides insight into our most intimate relationships and into ourselves. Chinese Astrology: Exploring the Eastern Zodiac explains our natural endowment or inner being - our personality from the beginning. This 5,000-year-old art paints a remarkable picture of personality and potential using the archetypes of the 12 signs of the ancient Eastern zodiac. While each one of us possess some qualities of all 12 signs, we each have a dominant sign and birth element.Be prepared for some ah ha! moments as you explore this ancient art and gain insight into the characters of those you meet along life's path. You may notice interesting similarities to your friends and family, and you may never look at yourself the same way again. This is a timeless system that is as pertinent today as it was many centuries ago.In a book that will fascinate both devotees of Western astrology and those who have never even checked their horoscopes in the newspaper, you'll learn The twelve signs of the Eastern Zodiac and what they tell you about yourself and others.The Five Elements, and how your birth element influences your destiny. Chinese love signs, karmic connections, and the secrets of soul mates.

The selection was made on the basis of recommendations from all the authors who contributed to the three volumes. Each of the studies is by a leading scholar: Benjamin Schwartz, Hui-chen Wang Liu, Charles O. Hucker, Joseph R. Levenson, Hans H. Frankel, Gung-wu Wang, Hellmut Wilhelm, Arthur F. Wright, James F. Cahill, Robert Ruhlmann, David S. Nivinson, Frederick W. Mote. Professor Wright, in his new introduction, says in summary that these essays 'are meant to illustrate the effects of the Confucian world view and its associated patterns of behavior on the development of Chinese civilization. They also suggest the Confucian tradition's capacity for adaptation, as well as something of its inner variety . . . Confucianism provided the normative ideas that brought Chinese society back, again and again, to long periods of stability, and creative achievement. As the central tradition of the massive human achievement that we call Chinese civilization, it deserves our attention and respect.'""",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4481085-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4481085-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/4481085-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4787353W/Confucianism_and_Chinese_civilization

0813389860,The geography of illegal drugs,George F. Rengert,1996,Westview Press,Geography,"This useful and readable compendium gives a fascinating account of how illegal drugs are transported into and around the United States and throughout its neighborhoods. Criminologist and geographer George F. Rengert takes a unique approach to the problem of illegal drug distribution and U.S. drug markets. Using maps and charts to illustrate his findings, Rengert applies spatial diffusion models to the illegal drug trade and explains why certain drugs are transported and found in different parts of the country. For example, the highest concentration of marijuana plants is not on either coast but rather across the middle of the United States - throughout what is known as the corn belt. At the local level Rengert assesses the patterns and processes that interconnect drug sales and neighborhood deterioration and change. The book also addresses the important issues of how illegal drugs in this country operate on wholesale and retail levels and ways in which law enforcement at the federal, state, and local levels contends with this widespread problem. Using ethnographic material to provide real-life examples, Rengert explores how drug dealers on the street expand spatially and predictably in their neighborhoods. He illustrates how this knowledge helps law enforcement in efforts to get these drugs off the streets.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12896662-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12896662-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12896662-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3257437W/The_geography_of_illegal_drugs

9780307346193,To hold the crown,Eleanor Burford,2008,Three Rivers Press,Kings and Rulers,"From exile and war to love and loss--every dynasty has a beginning.Henry Tudor was not born to the throne of England. Having come of age in a time of political turmoil and danger, the man who would become Henry VII spent fourteen years in exile in Brittany before returning triumphantly to the Dorset coast with a small army and decisively winning the Battle of Bosworth Field--ending the War of the Roses once and for all and launching the infamous Tudor dynasty.As Henry's claim to the throne was tenuous, his marriage to Elizabeth of York, daughter and direct heir of King Edward IV, not only served to unify the warring houses, it also helped Henry secure the throne for himself and for generations to come. And though their union was born from political necessity, it became a wonderful love story that led to seven children and twenty happy years together.Sweeping and dramatic, To Hold the Crown brings readers inside the genesis of the great Tudor empire: through Henry and Elizabeth's troubled ascensions to the throne, their marriage and rule, the heartbreak caused by the death of their son Arthur, and, ultimately, to the crowning of their younger son, King Henry VIII.

083719878X,The new religions of Japan,Harry Thomsen,1978,Greenwood Press,Religion,"THE PUBLICATION of this book will meet a conscious need among students of Japanese religion and culture because it presents in a series of factual and scholarly, yet not pedantic, expositions one of the significant developments of postwar Japan: the emergence and development of shinko shukyo, or ""new religions."" Mr. Thomsen, who has given himself to the study of these religions and is one of the younger missionaries who herald a return to the scholarly tradition so greatly neglected among postwar Christian missionaries and students, estimates that the new religions have about eighteen million followers, or one out of every five Japanese. Probably never before in the history of Japan have there been so many kinds of religious innovations and interests. This book is significant on several counts: it reflects the vitality of Japanese religion through the new religions, which perhaps are as representative of this vitality as any of the older traditional religions. It seriously considers this unique phenomenon of Japanese culture, which because of fanatical and superstitious acts among some of the followers has been treated with a reproach mingled with contempt, and because of obvious materialism and even charlatanry has led many to dismiss them with a quip or a laugh. On the other hand, some of the older religious groups are obviously alarmed over the increasing power of the new religions because they are seemingly able to meet many of the felt needs of the Japanese people. Mr. Thomsen considers the religious and sociological factors that have created these movements--the roots from which they have sprung--and goes a considerable distance toward establishing their common bonds. The book is important for the Christian student because it not only describes the encounter which Christianity has had with these new religions, but it also makes clear the difficulties missionaries have had in facing the Oriental syncretic concept of religion.",/images/icons/avatar_booS,/images/icons/avatar_booM,/images/icons/avatar_booL,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL6670219W/The_new_religions_of_Japan

1616204621,Cannibalism,Bill Schutt,2017,Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill,History,"""Eating one's own kind is completely natural behavior in thousands of species, including humans. Throughout history we have engaged in cannibalism for reasons relating to famine, burial rites, and medicinal remedies. Cannibalism has been used as a form of terrorism but also as the ultimate expression of filial piety. With unexpected wit and a wealth of knowledge, Bill Schutt, a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, takes us on a tour of the field, exploring exciting new avenues of research and investigating questions like why so many fish eat their offspring and some amphibians consume their mother's skin; why sexual cannibalism is an evolutionary advantage for certain spiders; why, until the end of the eighteenth century, British royalty regularly ate human body parts; how cannibalism may be linked to the extinction of Neanderthals; why microbes on sacramental bread may have led to Catholics' to persecute European Jews in the Middle Ages. Today, the subject of humans consuming one another has been relegated to the realm of horror movies, fiction, and the occasional psychopath, but be forewarned: As climate change progresses and humans see more famine, disease, and overcrowding, biological and cultural constraints may well disappear. These are the very factors that lead to outbreaks of cannibalism. As he examines these close encounters of the cannibal kind, Bill Schutt makes the ick-factor fascinating""--",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14448888-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14448888-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14448888-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20048086W/Cannibalism

1594204217,Cooked,Michael Pollan,2013,The Penguin Press,History,"""Fire, water, air, earth--our most trusted food expert recounts the story of his culinary education In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements--fire, water, air, and earth--to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook. Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan's effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements.^ A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse-trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius ""fermentos"" (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, the soil, farmers, our history and culture, and, of course, the people our cooking nourishes and delights. Cooking, above all, connects us. The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching.^ Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume huge quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.

0300181957,King Stephen,Edmund King,2012,Yale University Press,Kings and Rulers,"This compelling new biography provides the most authoritative picture yet of King Stephen, whose reign (1135-1154), with its ""nineteen long winters"" of civil war, made his name synonymous with failed leadership. After years of work on the sources, Edmund King shows with rare clarity the strengths and weaknesses of the monarch. Keeping Stephen at the forefront of his account, the author also chronicles the activities of key family members and associates whose loyal support sustained Stephen's kingship. In 1135 the popular Stephen was elected king against the claims of the empress Matilda and her sons. But by 1153, Stephen had lost control over Normandy and other important regions, England had lost prestige, and the weakened king was forced to cede his family's right to succession. A rich narrative covering the drama of a tumultuous reign, this book focuses well-deserved attention on a king who lost control of his destiny. - Publisher.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7089893-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7089893-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/7089893-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16574361W/King_Stephen

After her husband of twenty years leaves her for a younger woman, it's the discovery of Robbie's letters that gives Maggie a renewed sense of purpose: to return to Little Bear Lake and recapture the woman she once was - the woman she knows she could be again. But time has changed the place she knew and loved. The Harvest Moon dance hall where she worked as a waitress is closed. Still, Maggie is determined to reopen it, with the help of friends and a special man who enters her life in a most unexpected way. As they work together to make her dream come true, a powerful attraction develops between them. Maggie struggles with her feelings for a younger man whose age stands in the way of her growing affection for him.

This book redresses the balance and opens up some important areas for discussion. Christy Adair argues that dance is an arena for feminist practice, particularly as feminism has recognized the centrality of the arts in shaping our ideas about ourselves and our society."" ""Women's high profile in dance leads to the popular opinion that it is a female art form. But women tend to interpret rather than create dance images. This book highlights the consequences for female dancers of the development of Western dance technique in a patriarchal society. The constraints placed upon them are revealed in the texture of the dances discussed. Christy Adair shows how women's work which challenges traditional images of women in dance offers us visions for the future. But, she argues, in order for women's perspectives to be clearly established and influential, women need to have access to positions of power as choreographers and directors.""--Jacket.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3997866-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3997866-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/3997866-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4290038W/Women_and_dance

0300102534,The Artist's Reality,Mark Rothko,"September 11, 2004",Yale University Press,Artists,"""Mark Rothko (1903-1970) created a new and impassioned form of abstract painting over the course of his career. Rothko also wrote a number of essays and critical reviews during his lifetime, adding his thoughtful, intelligent, and opinionated voice to the debates of the contemporary art world. Although the artist never published a book of his varied and complex views, his heirs indicate that he occasionally spoke of the existence of such a manuscript to friends and colleagues. Stored in a warehouse since the artist's death more than thirty years ago, this manuscript, titled The Artist's Reality, is now being published for the first time."" ""This book discusses Rothko's ideas on the modern art world, art history, myth, beauty, the challenges of being an artist in society, the true nature of ""American art,"" and much more The Artist's Reality also includes an introduction by Christopher Rothko, the artist's son, who describes the discovery of the manuscript and the complicated and fascinating process of bringing the manuscript to publication. The introduction is illustrated with a small selection of relevant examples of the artist's own work as well as with a reproduction of a page from the actual manuscript.""--BOOK JACKET.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/162282-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/162282-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/162282-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1733633W/The_Artist's_Reality

8845246329,Agostino,Alberto Moravia,2000,Bompiani,English,"Thirteen-year-old Agostino is spending the summer at a Tuscan seaside resort with his beautiful widowed mother. When she takes up with a cocksure new companion, Agostino, feeling ignored and unloved, begins hanging around with a group of local young toughs. Though repelled by their squalor and brutality, and repeatedly humiliated for his weakness and ignorance when it comes to women and sex, the boy is increasingly, masochistically drawn to the gang and its rough games. He finds himself unable to make sense of his troubled feelings. Hoping to be full of manly calm, he is instead beset by guilty  curiosity and an urgent desire to sever, at any cost, the thread of troubled sensuality that binds him to his mother. Alberto Moravia’s classic, startling portrait of innocence lost was written in 1942 but rejected by Fascist censors and not published until 1944, when it became a best seller and secured the author the first literary prize of his career. Revived here in a new translation by Michael F. Moore, Agostino is poised to captivate a twenty-first-century audience.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12631426-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12631426-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12631426-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14857506W/Agostino

Or rather, with several faces, since his work ranged from the political to the religious, from the urbane to the pastoral, from the mandarin to the invigoratingly plain-spoken. This collection presents all the poems Auden wished to preserve, in the texts that received his final approval. It includes the full contents of his previous collected editions along with all the later volumes of his shorter poems. Together, these works display the astonishing range of Auden's voice and the breadth of his concerns, his deep knowledge of the traditions he inherited, and his ability to recast those traditions in modern times.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/420088-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/420088-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/420088-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1167846W/Poems

Lynn Staley's new translation does not modernize; rather, it stays as close to the original Middle English as possible without sounding archaic. The text is accompanied by explanatory annotations, a map of medieval England, and a Kempe lexicon."" """"Contexts"" collects primary readings chosen to inform readers about late-medieval religious authority, mysticism, and expressions of worship. Included are excerpts from The Constitutions of Thomas Arundel, Meditations on the Life of Christ, The Shewings of Julian of Norwich, The Book of Saint Bride, and The Life of Marie d'Oignies by Jacques de Vitry.""

L. Doctorow, and Frank Rich, into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone who wants to put their best foot forward in writing prose. Dreyer offers lessons on the ins and outs of punctuation and grammar, including how to navigate the words he calls 'the confusables,' like tricky homophones; the myriad ways to use (and misuse) a comma; and how to recognize--though not necessarily do away with--the passive voice. (Hint: If you can plausibly add 'by zombies' to the end of a sentence, it's passive.) People are sharing their writing more than ever--on blogs, on Twitter--and this book lays out, clearly and comprehensibly, everything writers can do to keep readers focused on the real reason writers write: to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. Chock-full of advice, insider wisdom, and fun facts on the rules (and nonrules) of the English language, this book will prove invaluable to everyone who wants to shore up their writing skills, mandatory for people who spend their time editing and shaping other people's prose, and--perhaps best of all--an utter treat for anyone who simply revels in language""--",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8806564-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8806564-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8806564-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20161012W/Dreyer's_English

067103264X,Storm of the Century,Stephen King,1999-02,Pocket Books,Picture Books,"For the first time in Stephen King's remarkable publishing history, the master storyteller presents an all-new, original tale written expressly for the television screen. They're calling it the Storm of the Century, and it's coming hard. The residents of Little Tall Island have seen their share of nasty Maine Nor'easters, but this one is different. Not only is it packing hurricane-force winds and up to five feet of snow, it's bringing something worse. Something even the islanders have never seen before. Something no one wants to see. Just as the first flakes begin to fall, Martha Clarendon, one of Little Tall Island's oldest residents, suffers an unspeakably violent death. While her blood dries, Andre Linoge, the man responsible sits calmly in Martha's easy chair holding his cane topped with a silver wolf's head . . . waiting. Linoge knows the townsfolk will come to arrest him. He will let them. For he has come to the island for one reason. And when he meets Constable Mike Anderson, his beautiful wife and child, and the rest of Little Tall's tight-knit community, this stranger will make one simple proposition to them all: ""If you give me what I want, I'll go away.""(back cover)",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14651955-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14651955-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14651955-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL81592W/Storm_of_the_Century

9781138244399,Photography and Migration,Tanya Sheehan,2018,Taylor & Francis Group,Photography,"Written in the context of unprecedented dislocation and a global refugee crisis, this edited volume thinks through photography's long and complex relationship to human migration. While contemporary media images largely frame migration in terms of trauma, victimhood, and pity, so much more can be said of photography's role in the movement of people around the world. Cameras can document, enable, or control human movement across geographical, cultural, and political divides. Their operators put faces on forced and voluntary migrations, making visible hardships and suffering as well as opportunity and optimism. Photographers include migrating subjects who take pictures for their own consumption, not for international recognition. And photographs themselves migrate with their makers, subjects, and viewers, as the very concept of photography takes on new functions and meanings. Photography and Migration places into conversation media images and other photographs that the contributors have witnessed, collected, or created through their diverse national, regional, and local contexts. Developed across thirteen chapters, this conversation encompasses images, histories, and testimonies offering analysis of new perspectives on photography and migration today.",/images/icons/avatar_booS,/images/icons/avatar_booM,/images/icons/avatar_booL,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21349177W/Photography_and_Migration

9780240812755,Photography as activism,Michelle Bogre,2011,Focal Press,Photography,"""In Photography as Activism, Michelle Bogre discusses the philosophy and history of photography's role in social reform. Beginning with the invention of the camera, she traces the earliest instances of photographic activism through to today's emerging practices, profiling the most prominent activists of their time and their legendary images. Also profiled are contemporary photographer activists, including Jonathan Torgovnik. A photograph from Torgovnik's activist project, Intended Consequences, about the mass rape of Tutsi women during the Rwanda genocide in 1994, is featured on the cover of this book. His photographs spread awareness of the consequences of genocide and sexual violence, and have helped the Rwanda Foundation (www.foundationrwanda.org) that he created raise more than a million dollars to fund secondary school education for the children. Other featured photographers include: -Eugene Richards -Marcus Bleasdale -Tom Stoddart -Jonathan Torgovnik -Edward Kashi -Brent Stirton -Stephen Dupont -Walter Astrada With an appendix featuring additional websites, magazines, galleries, festivals, foundations, grants, and advice for the budding activist, this book is not only a comprehensive study of activist photography, but also a call to action for photographers with a cause""--",/images/icons/avatar_booS,/images/icons/avatar_booM,/images/icons/avatar_booL,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16190768W/Photography_as_activism

184195716X,A Short History of Myth,Karen Armstrong,"October 5, 2005",Canongate U.S.,History,"“Human beings have always been mythmakers.” So begins best-selling writer Karen Armstrong’s concise yet compelling investigation into myth: what it is, how it has evolved, and why we still so desperately need it. She takes us from the Paleolithic period and the myths of the hunters right up to the “Great Western Transformation” of the last five hundred years and the discrediting of myth by science. The history of myth is the history of humanity, our stories and beliefs, our curiosity and attempts to understand the world, which link us to our ancestors and each other. Heralding a major series of retellings of international myths by authors from around the world, Armstrong’s characteristically insightful and eloquent book serves as a brilliant and thought-provoking introduction to myth in the broadest sense—and explains why if we dismiss it, we do so at our peril.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/888780-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/888780-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/888780-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3280812W/A_Short_History_of_Myth

9780805057232,Dancing in the streets,Barbara Ehrenreich,2007,Metropolitan Books,History,"""Cultural historian Ehrenreich explores a human impulse that has been so effectively suppressed that we lack even a term for it: the desire for collective joy, historically expressed in ecstatic revels of feasting, costuming, and dancing. She uncovers the origins of communal celebration in human biology and culture. Although 16th-century Europeans viewed mass festivities as foreign and ""savage,"" Ehrenreich shows that they were indigenous to the West, from the ancient Greeks to medieval Christianity. Ultimately, church officials drove the festivities into the streets, Protestants criminalized carnival, Wahhabist Muslims battled ecstatic Sufism, European colonizers wiped out native dance rites. The elites' fear that such gatherings would undermine social hierarchies was justified: the festive tradition inspired uprisings and revolutions from France to the Caribbean to the American plains. Yet outbreaks of group revelry persist, as Ehrenreich shows, pointing to the 1960s rock-and-roll rebellion and the more recent ""carnivalization"" of sports.--From publisher description.""--From source other than the Library of Congress",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6752534-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6752534-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6752534-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2520830W/Dancing_in_the_Streets

187937367X,The IRA,Tim Pat Coogan,1993,Roberts Rinehart Publishers,History,"""The Irish Republican Army (IRA) (Irish: Óglaigh na hÉireann[1]) was an Irish republican revolutionary military organisation. It was descended from the Irish Volunteers, an organisation established on 25 November 1913 that staged the Easter Rising in April 1916. In 1919, the Irish Republic that had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising was formally established by an elected assembly (Dáil Éireann), and the Irish Volunteers were recognised by Dáil Éireann as its legitimate army. Thereafter, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule in Ireland in the 191921 Irish War of Independence. Following the signing in 1921 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which ended the War of Independence, a split occurred within the IRA. Members who supported the treaty formed the nucleus of the Irish National Army founded by IRA leader Michael Collins. However, much of the IRA was opposed to the treaty. The anti-treaty IRA fought a civil war with their former comrades in 192223, with the intention of creating a fully independent all-Ireland republic. Having lost the civil war, this group remained in existence, with the intention of overthrowing both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland and achieving the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916.""--Wikipedia.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10268782-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10268782-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10268782-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3045875W/The_I.R.A

0810911639,History of Italian Renaissance art,Frederick Hartt,1987,Abrams,History,"For over twenty years, Frederick Hartt's History of Italian Renaissance Art has been considered the best book ever written on this important period in Western art. Comprehensive, well-illustrated, and entertaining, it is also a model of clarity and scholarly precision. Now, the fourth edition of this unrivaled classic is provided for another generation of readers. This newly designed edition includes an extended presentation of the Quattrocento and Cinquecento in Florence, Rome, and Venice, as well as additional pictured works by north Italian artists and by Florentine artists of the Maniera. The revising author, David Wilkins, has remained sympathetic and sensitive to Hartt's vision and approach while drawing upon the latest research to bring the text up to date. There are many new colorplates, including fourteen details of Michelangelo's freshly cleaned, resplendent Sistine Ceiling frescoes. A portfolio of full-page color room views has been added as well, showing major works of art in situ. Many paintings and sculptures have been rephotographed specially for this edition since they were cleaned and restored, and many more are now illustrated in larger size. Because context is so important to the understanding of Renaissance art, information has been added to the captions indicating when a work is still in its original location. And, when known, the name of the patron who commissioned a work has been added. Frederick Hartt writes with authority and eloquence on the sculpture, architecture, and painting of more than four centuries, and David Wilkins has respected and maintained his high standards. The Renaissance was an extraordinarily fertile era, when, in a burst of staggering creativity, humanist painters rediscovered and gave new meaning to portraiture and landscape painting; sculptors fashioned life-sized freestanding figures with remarkable virtuosity and revived the classical ideal of the nude; and architects planned and built edifices of rare grace and invention. Beautiful illustrations, fine writing, and authoritative scholarship bring into focus all the elements of this multifaceted period. Fully indexed, and including an extensive glossary and an updated bibliography, the fourth edition of History of Italian Renaissance Art offers a fresh and inviting design, displaying the extraordinary visual and textual material to full advantage.",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10991231-S,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10991231-M,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10991231-L,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3900753W/History_of_Italian_Renaissance_art
